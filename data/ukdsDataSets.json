Commitments are considered to be made at the date a loan or grant agreement is signed or the obligation is otherwise made known to the recipient (e.g. in the case of budgetary allocations to overseas territories, the final vote of the budget should be taken as the date of commitment). For certain special expenditures, e.g. emergency aid, the date of disbursement may be taken as the date of commitment. Bilateral commitments comprise new commitments and additions to earlier commitments, excluding any commitments cancelled during the same year. Cancellations and reductions in the year reported on of commitments made in earlier years are reported in the CRS, but not in the DAC questionnaire. In contrast to bilateral commitments, commitments of capital subscriptions, grants and loans to multilateral agencies should show the sum of amounts which are expected to be disbursed before the end of the next year and amounts disbursed in the year reported on but not previously reported as a commitment. For capital subscriptions in the form of notes payable at sight, enter the expected amount of deposits of such notes as the amount committed."

          "itemCoverage": "As a consequence of the implementation of the new OECD Global Insurance Statistics' framework, there is a break in series between 2008 and 2009 regarding life and non-life business data where composite insurance undertakings exist. Up until 2008, the insurance business is broken down between life and non-life business. As of 2009, the insurance business is broken down between the business of pure life, pure non-life and composite undertakings and composite undertakings' business is further broken down between life and non-life business. Some countries do not allow for insurance undertakings to be active in both life and non-life insurance business and therefore composite insurance undertakings do not exist in these countries. In other countries (e.g., Austria, Belgium, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, Portugal, Spain) however, the share of employment in composite insurance undertakings accounts for more than half of the whole domestic insurance sector. Therefore, to have comparable data across years for life business data (resp. non-life), one has to sum up the life (resp. non-life) business of pure life (resp. non-life) undertakings and the life (resp. non-life) business of composite undertakings as of 2009."

As of 2009, the insurance business is broken down between the business of pure life, pure non-life and composite undertakings and composite undertakings' business is further broken down between life and non-life business. Some countries do not allow for insurance undertakings to be active in both life and non-life insurance business and therefore composite insurance undertakings do not exist in these countries. In other countries (e.g., Austria, Belgium, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, Portugal, Spain) however, the share of employment in composite insurance undertakings accounts for more than half of the whole domestic insurance sector. Therefore, to have comparable data across years for life business data (resp. non-life), one has to sum up the life (resp. non-life) business of pure life (resp. non-life) undertakings and the life (resp. non-life) business of composite undertakings as of 2009."

          "keyStatisticalConcept": "Following the UN recommendations defined by the Economic and Social Council of the Statistical Commission of the United Nations in \"International Merchandise Trade Statistics: Concepts and Definitions (1998)\", the international merchandise trade statistics record all goods which add to or subtract from the stock of material resources of a country by entering (imports) or leaving (exports) its economic territory. Goods simply being transported through a country (goods in transit) or temporarily admitted or withdrawn (except for goods for inward or outward processing) do not add to or subtract from the stock of material resources of a country and are not included in the international merchandise trade statistics. Customs records should be the main source of the data; and the additional sources could be used where customs sources are not available. Goods should be included in statistics at the time when they enter or leave the economic territory of a country. In the case of customs-based data collection systems, the time of recording should be the date of lodgement of the customs declaration.Lists of goods to be included, to be recorded separately and to be excluded should be provided. Specific goods are to be excluded from detailed international merchandise trade statistics but recorded separately in order to derive totals of international merchandise trade for national accounts and balance of payments purposes.Trade systemThere are two trade systems in common use by which international merchandise trade statistics are compiled: general trade system and special trade system. The United Nations recommendations advise using the general trade system that provides a more comprehensive recording of external trade flows than does the special system. It also provides a better approximation of the change of ownership criterion used in the 1993 SNA and BPM5. General trade includes all goods that cross the national frontier including goods that are imported into and exported from custom-bonded warehouses and free zones. The general trade system is in use when the statistical territory of a country coincides with its economic territory so that imports include all goods entering the economic territory of a compiling country and exports include all goods leaving the economic territory of a compiling country.Special trade covers goods that cross the customs frontier plus goods that are imported into and exported from custom-bonded areas. The special trade system is in use when the statistical territory comprises only a particular part of the economic territory. Coverage of tradeThe data cover all goods which add to, or subtract from, the resources of a country as a result of their movement into or out of the country. The following types of goods are therefore included or excluded:Goods to be included in the detailed international trade statistics:- Non-monetary gold; goods traded on government account; food and other humanitarian aid; goods for military use; goods on consignment; goods used as carriers of information and software (CD-ROM, diskettes); goods for processing; returned goods; electricity, gas and water; goods under financial lease; ships, aircraft and other mobile equipment; sea products landed direct from the high seas.Goods to be excluded in the detailed international trade statistics:- Monetary gold, direct transit trade, temporary imports and exports, transactions in second-hand ships and aircraft, stores and bunkers for ships and aircraft; goods treated as part of trade in services; goods for repair.MethodologyTrade data collected by OECD mostly follow the UN recommendations. Furthermore, in European countries, two systems of data collection coexist, i.e. Extra-stats and Intrastat. Extra-EU trade statistics record movable property imported and exported by the EU Member country from and to countries outside the European community. Intra-EU trade statistics include the arrival and dispatch of movable property within the European community as recorded by each Member state of the EU.Geographical classificationThe geographical classification refers to areas of origin (or country of consignment) for imports and areas of consumption (last known destination) for exports. The statistical territory of these countries is defined in the OECD Geographical Nomenclature."

In particular, the introduction of Intrastat in 1993 involved a methodological break with the past and affected the quality of the statistics.",
          "recommendedUsesAndLimitations": "UK Data Service Guide to OECD Monthly Statistics of International TradeDifferences between OECD statistics and Community statistics of EurostatThe Monthly Statistics of International Trade now publishes data received directly from the Statistical Office of the European Communities (EUROSTAT) under the name EU15-Extra EU and EU12-Extra EU which excludes intra EU-trade.As the example below shows, Community statistics, which cover the European Union as a whole, and the statistics compiled by the EU Member States and sent to OECD, which are concerned with the national dimension, are not always directly comparable. There can be methodological differences, which make precise comparison of these statistics impossible.The principal differences are as follows:- Breakdown by partner countryFor arrivals of goods from other EU Member States, certain EU Member States record the country of origin as the partner country in their national statistics, whereas it is the EU Member State of consignment that appears in the Community statistics relating to the same goods movement. - Treatment of goods in transitSome EU Member States, particularly Belgium and the Netherlands do not record goods, which they consider to be 'in transit'. This covers, firstly, the import of goods from non-member countries which are customs cleared in these EU Member States before being dispatched on to other EU Member States and, secondly, goods from other EU Member States which are then immediately re-exported to non-member countries.These goods are normally recorded for Community Statistics purposes under intra- or extra-EU trade, as appropriate. This phenomenon is known as the 'Rotterdam effect'- Other differencesOther methodological differences can cause discrepancies between national and Community statistics (for example: classification at national level as 'general trade' rather than 'special trade', or not recording 'repairs' on the grounds that they are considered as services)."

          "recommendedUsesAndLimitations": "UK Data Service Guide to OECD Tax Statistics The simple approach of comparing the tax/benefit position of example households avoids many of the conceptual and definitional problems involved in more complex international comparisons of tax burdens and transfer programmes. However, a drawback of this methodology is that the earnings of an average worker will usually occupy a different position in the overall income distribution in different economies, although the earnings relate to workers in similar jobs in various OECD Member countries.Because of the limitations on the taxes and benefits covered in the Report, the data cannot be taken as an indication of the overall impact of the government sector on the welfare of taxpayers and their families. Complete coverage would require studies of the impact of indirect taxes, the treatment of non-wage labour income and other income components under personal income taxes and the effect of other tax allowances and cash benefits. Complete coverage would also require that consideration be given to the effect on welfare of services provided by the state, either free or below cost, and the incidence of corporate and other direct taxes on earnings and prices. Such a broad coverage is not possible in an international comparison of all OECD countries. The differences between the results shown here and those of a full study of the overall impact on employees of government interventions in the economy would vary from one country to another. They would depend on the relative shares of different kinds of taxes in government revenues and on the scope and nature of government social expenditures.The Report shows only the formal incidence of taxes on employees and employers. The final, economic incidence of taxes may be quite different, because the tax burden may be shifted from employers onto employees and vice versa by market adjustments to gross wages.The income left at the disposal of a taxpayer may represent different standards of living in various countries because the range of goods and services on which the income is spent and their relative prices differ as between countries. In those countries where the general government sector provides a wide range of goods and services (generous basic old age pension, free health services, public housing, university education, etcetera), the taxpayer may be left with less cash income but may enjoy the same living standards as a taxpayer receiving a higher cash income but living in a country where there are fewer publicly provided goods and services."

Some countries do not allow for insurance undertakings to be active in both life and non-life insurance business and therefore composite insurance undertakings do not exist in these countries. In other countries (e.g., Austria, Belgium, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, Portugal, Spain) however, the share of employment in composite insurance undertakings accounts for more than half of the whole domestic insurance sector. Therefore, to have comparable data across years for life business data (resp. non-life), one has to sum up the life (resp. non-life) business of pure life (resp. non-life) undertakings and the life (resp. non-life) business of composite undertakings as of 2009."

The base of this tax was the same as the ordinary income tax base and the two have now been incorporated into a single income tax.Heading 5121: From October 1986 incorporates that portion of the selective impost on wine, spirits, tobacco and motor vehicles which was formerly collected and reported as sales tax. The revenue collected on those imported goods which are subject to the equivalent of the domestic excise has been classified as excise duty. In this respect, there is a discontinuity between the excises recorded before and after October 1986.Heading 5210: The other local authority licence fees include some small items which could be regarded as non-tax revenues.Heading for non-wastable tax credits 1110 comprises four Family assistance tax credits.

The following method is adopted separately for Working Families 'Tax Credit and Disabled Persons Tax Credit' paid from 1999 to 2003. For each calendar, a random sample of awards over-lapping the quarter is taken. Each recipient family's income tax liability for the fiscal year within which the quarter falls is calculated , based on the earned income reported for the award (uprated to the middle of the overlap period). And the result multiplied by the number of days in the overlap period divided by 365. The tax expenditure component is defined as the minimum of this amount and the total amount of award paid in the overlap period. The total amount of award paid and the tax expenditure component are each summed over the sample cases, and the ratio is taken as the tax expenditure ration for the quarter. From 2003, the equivalent breakdown for Child and Working tax credits is based on household survey data. Survey data is used to estimate the breakdown into the tax expenditure and the transfer components for the other smaller tax credits.Source: National Income and Expenditure; Central Statistical Office; Annual reports of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs."

          "abstract": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS) database contains data on the value of merchandise exports and imports between each country and all its trading partners. Total bilateral and multilateral exports and imports are aggregated at national or regional group level. For each reporting country or group, all the trading partners are listed. The corresponding monetary values of total imports and total exports are then provided as time series for each country/trading partner pair. All exports are valued free on board (f.o.b.). Imports are usually reported cost including insurance and freight (c.i.f.), although a small number of countries report imports f.o.b. Along with data from reporting countries, estimates are provided by partner countries for non-reporting countries or for those that are slow to report. The period for which data are available varies from country to country, but most countries data extend from the 1980s to the present. The Direction of Trade pre-1980 data is found in the DOTS Historical database which runs from 1948 to 1980. There can be inconsistencies between exports to a partner and the partner's recorded imports from a particular country, i.e. the exports from Country A to B do not always equal the imports of Country B from A. This is due to the different ways countries report their trade, i.e. differences in classification concepts and detail, time of recording, valuation, and coverage, as well as processing errors. The Documentation on the Direction of Trade CD available via the dataset user guide, provides more information on sources of inconsistency. This database was first provided by UK Data Service in December 2003. The UK Data Service web site includes further information on its IMF Direction of Trade Statistics holdings, including a dataset user guide and details of latest database updates."

The classification between public and private institution is made according to whether a public agency or a private entity has the ultimate control over the institution. For private institutions, the distinction between government-dependent and independent refers only to the degree of a private institution's dependence on funding from government sources: a government-dependent private institution receives 50% or more of its core funding from government agencies or one whose teaching personnel are paid by government agency. An independent private institution is one that receives less than 50% of its core funding from government agencies and whose teaching personnel are not paid by a government agency.",

Current expenditure is expenditure on goods and services consumed within the current year, i.e. expenditure that needs to be made recurrently in order to sustain the production of educational services. Minor expenditure on items of equipment, below a certain cost threshold, is also reported as current spending. Current expenditure is broken down into expenditure on compensation personnel and expenditure on other resources. Capital expenditure is expenditure on assets that last longer than one year. It includes spending on construction, renovation and major repair of buildings and expenditure on new or replacement equipment. The total funds received by educational institutions from all sources may not be precisely equal to total expenditure in the reference period. This is because the institutions have either added to or reduced their fund balances during the period in question.",

It is a measure of how effectively a pension system provides income during retirement to replace earnings, the main source of income prior to retirement. The net replacement rate is defined as the individual net pension entitlement divided by net pre-retirement earnings, taking account of personal income taxes and social security contributions paid by workers and pensioners. Gross pension wealth shows the size of the lump sum that would be needed to buy a flow of pension payments equivalent to that promised by the mandatory pension system in each country. It is measured and expressed as a multiple of gross annual individual earnings.Net pension wealth is the present value of the flow of pension benefits, taking account of the taxes and social security contributions that retirees have to pay on their pensions. It is measured and expressed as a multiple of gross annual individual earnings in the respective country. The reason for using gross earnings as the comparator is to isolate the effect of taxes and contributions paid in retirement from those paid when working. This definition means that gross and net pension wealth are the same when people are not liable for contributions and income taxes on their pensions.Earnings - Gross annual earnings, in national currencyNet annual earnings, in national currencyGross average annual wage (100%), in national currency"

Annual data refer to monthly or quarterly averages or to a specific month of each year.(1) Economic activities are defined according to the Major divisions of the International standard International Classification (ISIC). Data are presented according to the latest revisions of the ISIC: Revision 2 (1968), Revision 3 (1990) and Revision 4 with the exception of the United States for which data is only available in Revision 2 until 2002 only.There are years for which data are available in both Revision 2 and 3. This overlap period varies from 10 years for Canadian data to one year for Japan data.In some cases, the data according to both revisions are updated while only the latest is revised in other cases. This explains why in some cases, the level of employment or the number of employees are different according to the two ISIC revisions. Unless otherwise specified in the country notes data are compiled from the Labour Force Surveys.(2) The professional status is defined in the International Classification by status in Employment (ICSE-1993).

An important example is recycling which is included only to the extent that it constitutes a substitute for waste management.Excluded are:Activities that, while beneficial to the environment, primarily satisfy technical needs or health and safety requirements for the protection of the workplace.Expenditure linked to mobilisation of natural resources (e.g., water supply).Calculated cost items such as depreciation (consumption of fixed capital) or the cost of capital as this questionnaire only records actual outlays.Payments of interest, fines and penalties for non-compliance with environmental regulations or compensations to third parties etc., as they are not directly linked with an environmental protection activity.Environmental Protection Expenditure can be evaluated both according to the abater principle and the financing principle. This distinction makes it possible to aggregate different sectors and industries without double counting.Expenditure according to the abater principle (EXP I), includes all expenditure that the sector has for measures they themselves execute. Any economic benefits directly linked with the environmental protection activities (Receipts from by-products) are deducted in order to calculate the net amount of money spent by the sector for their own activities.The financing principle (EXP II) measures how much money a particular sector (directly) contributes to overall environmental protection activities, wherever they are executed. This means that the part of EXP I that was directly financed by others (through subsidies or revenues received) should be deducted, while the part of EXP I in other sectors that this sector finances directly (through subsidies or fees paid) should be added.The framework is based on double entry bookkeeping, where each activity and expenditure item has an abater (producer) and a financing side. This means that much expenditure by specialised producers is financed by the users of their services, mainly business sector and households. This will be recorded as Revenues for the Specialised producers (Table 4), and fees/purchases in Business and Households (Tables 2 and 3).Specialised producers include the production of environmental protection services by public and private corporations or quasi-corporations for the use of other units, mainly financed by the users of these services. These are mainly activities within ISIC Rev. 4/NACE Rev. 2 division and classes 37, 38.1, 38.2 and 39 such as: 37 Sewerage, 38.1 Waste collection, 38.2 Waste treatment and disposal, 39 Remediation activities and other waste management services. This sector is the sum of two components:Public specialised producers: All corporations and quasi-corporations that are subject to control by government units. Control is defined as the ability to determine general corporate policy by choosing appropriate directors, if necessary (Table 4A).Private specialised producers: All corporations and quasi-corporations that are not subject to control by government units (Table 4B).Specialised producers could also include for example the activities of e.g. volunteer environmental organisations or secondary environmental activities. These should be entered along with a footnote describing the coverage.CEPA domains: a column \"pollution abatement and control\" (PAC) has been kept in the questionnaire to ensure continuity with earlier data series."

It can be argued that where enterprise A has a partly owned subsidiary B, which itself has a subsidiary C whose existence depends on B, not A, that C should not be included as part of A's foreign direct investment. However, in practice it is difficult to make this type of distinction as A may have complete control of its partly owned subsidiaries and may have decided to invest in C through B rather than through some other channel.

          "keyStatisticalConcept": "General Note on Main concepts and definitions of foreign direct investment (FDI) and data presentation Foreign direct investmentForeign direct investment reflects the objective of obtaining a lasting interest by a resident entity in one economy (‘‘direct investor'') in an entity resident in an economy other than that of the investor (‘‘direct investment enterprise''). The lasting interest implies the existence of a long-term relationship between the direct investor and the enterprise and a significant degree of influence on the management of the enterprise. Direct investment involves both the initial transaction between the two entities and all subsequent capital transactions between them and among affiliated enterprises, both incorporated and unincorporated.Foreign direct investor (outward investment for reporting country)A foreign direct investor is an individual, an incorporated or unincorporated public or private enterprise, a government, a group of related individuals, or a group of related incorporated and/or unincorporated enterprises which has a direct investment enterprise - that is, a subsidiary, associate or branch - operating in a country other than the country or countries of residence of the foreign direct investor or investors.Direct investment enterprise (inward investment for reporting country)A direct investment enterprise is define as an incorporated or unincorporated enterprise in which a foreign investor owns 10 per cent or more of the ordinary shares or voting power of an incorporated enterprise or the equivalent of an unincorporated enterprise.The numerical guideline of ownership of 10 per cent of ordinary shares or voting stock determines the existence of a direct investment relationship. An effective voice in the management, as evidenced by an ownership of at least 10 per cent, implies that the direct investor is able to influence or participate in the management of an enterprise; it does not require absolute control by the foreign investor.Although not recommended by the OECD, some countries may still feel it necessary to treat the 10 per cent cut-off point in a flexible manner to fit the circumstances. In some cases, the ownership of 10 per cent of the ordinary shares or voting power may not lead to the exercise of any significant influence while, on the other hand, a direct investor may own less than 10 per cent but have an effective voice in the management. OECD does not recommend any qualifications to the 10 per cent rule. Consequently, countries that choose not to follow the 10 per cent rule in all cases should identify, where possible, the aggregate value of transactions not falling under the 10 per cent cut-off rule, so as to facilitate international comparability.Some countries may consider that the existence of elements of a direct investment relationship may be indicated by a combination of factors such as: - representation on the board of directors;- participation in policy-making processes;- material inter-company transactions;- interchange of managerial personnel;- provision of technical information;- provision of long-term loans at lower than existing market rates.Other relationships may exist between enterprises in different economies which exhibit the characteristics set out above, although there is no formal link with regard to shareholding. For example, two enterprises, each operating in different economies, may have a common board and common policy making and may share resources including funds but with neither having a shareholding in the other of 10 per cent or more. In such cases where neither is a direct investment enterprise of the other, the transactions could be treated as between related subsidiaries. These are not regarded as direct investment.BreakdownsFDI flows and positions are broken down separately as follows:-1. FDI flows1.1 FDI inflowsa) country or economic zone b) industry sector based ISIC3 (and NACE)1.2 FDI outflows a) country or economic zoneb) industry scetor based ISIC3 (and NACE)2. FDI Positions2.1 Inward FDI positiona) country or economic zoneb) industry sector based ISIC3 (and NACE)2.2 Outward FDI positiona) country or economic zoneb) industry sector based ISIC3 (and NACE)",
          "validation": "ValuationThe OECD Benchmark Definition recommends market value as the conceptual basis for valuation. Market valuation places all assets at current prices rather than when purchased or last revalued, and allows comparability of assets of different vintages. It allows for consistency between flows and stocks of assets of different enterprises, industries, and countries, as well as over time. However, in practice book values from the balance sheets of direct investment enterprises (or investors) are generally utilised to determine the value of the stocks of direct investment. This approach reflects the fact that enterprise balance sheet values - whether they are regularly revalued on a current market value basis, reported on a historical cost basis, or are based on some interim but not current revaluation - represent the only source of valuation of assets and liabilities readily available in most countries. (In the first case, the balance sheet value is, in fact, the market value). The collection of data from enterprises on a current market value basis is to be encouraged, to narrow the gap between principle and practice."

OECD does not recommend any qualifications to the 10 per cent rule. Consequently, countries that choose not to follow the 10 per cent rule in all cases should identify, where possible, the aggregate value of transactions not falling under the 10 per cent cut-off rule, so as to facilitate international comparability.Some countries may consider that the existence of elements of a direct investment relationship may be indicated by a combination of factors such as: - representation on the board of directors;- participation in policy-making processes;- material inter-company transactions;- interchange of managerial personnel;- provision of technical information;- provision of long-term loans at lower than existing market rates.Other relationships may exist between enterprises in different economies which exhibit the characteristics set out above, although there is no formal link with regard to shareholding. For example, two enterprises, each operating in different economies, may have a common board and common policy making and may share resources including funds but with neither having a shareholding in the other of 10 per cent or more. In such cases where neither is a direct investment enterprise of the other, the transactions could be treated as between related subsidiaries. These are not regarded as direct investment.BreakdownsFDI flows and positions are broken down separately as follows:-1.

However, in practice it is difficult to make this type of distinction as A may have complete control of its partly owned subsidiaries and may have decided to invest in C through B rather than through some other channel.

The lasting interest implies the existence of a long-term relationship between the direct investor and the enterprise and a significant degree of influence on the management of the enterprise. Direct investment involves both the initial transaction between the two entities and all subsequent capital transactions between them and among affiliated enterprises, both incorporated and unincorporated.Foreign direct investor (outward investment for reporting country)A foreign direct investor is an individual, an incorporated or unincorporated public or private enterprise, a government, a group of related individuals, or a group of related incorporated and/or unincorporated enterprises which has a direct investment enterprise - that is, a subsidiary, associate or branch - operating in a country other than the country or countries of residence of the foreign direct investor or investors.Direct investment enterprise (inward investment for reporting country)A direct investment enterprise is define as an incorporated or unincorporated enterprise in which a foreign investor owns 10 per cent or more of the ordinary shares or voting power of an incorporated enterprise or the equivalent of an unincorporated enterprise.The numerical guideline of ownership of 10 per cent of ordinary shares or voting stock determines the existence of a direct investment relationship. An effective voice in the management, as evidenced by an ownership of at least 10 per cent, implies that the direct investor is able to influence or participate in the management of an enterprise; it does not require absolute control by the foreign investor.Although not recommended by the OECD, some countries may still feel it necessary to treat the 10 per cent cut-off point in a flexible manner to fit the circumstances.

The legal structures of groups of related enterprises are very complex and may bear no relationship to the management responsibilities. It can be argued that where enterprise A has a partly owned subsidiary B, which itself has a subsidiary C whose existence depends on B, not A, that C should not be included as part of A's foreign direct investment. However, in practice it is difficult to make this type of distinction as A may have complete control of its partly owned subsidiaries and may have decided to invest in C through B rather than through some other channel. For this reason OECD considers that inward and outward direct investment statistics should, as a matter of principle, cover all directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries, associates, and branches."

          "keyStatisticalConcept": "General Note on Main concepts and definitions of foreign direct investment (FDI) and data presentation Foreign direct investmentForeign direct investment reflects the objective of obtaining a lasting interest by a resident entity in one economy (‘‘direct investor'') in an entity resident in an economy other than that of the investor (‘‘direct investment enterprise''). The lasting interest implies the existence of a long-term relationship between the direct investor and the enterprise and a significant degree of influence on the management of the enterprise. Direct investment involves both the initial transaction between the two entities and all subsequent capital transactions between them and among affiliated enterprises, both incorporated and unincorporated.Foreign direct investor (outward investment for reporting country)A foreign direct investor is an individual, an incorporated or unincorporated public or private enterprise, a government, a group of related individuals, or a group of related incorporated and/or unincorporated enterprises which has a direct investment enterprise - that is, a subsidiary, associate or branch - operating in a country other than the country or countries of residence of the foreign direct investor or investors.Direct investment enterprise (inward investment for reporting country)A direct investment enterprise is define as an incorporated or unincorporated enterprise in which a foreign investor owns 10 per cent or more of the ordinary shares or voting power of an incorporated enterprise or the equivalent of an unincorporated enterprise.The numerical guideline of ownership of 10 per cent of ordinary shares or voting stock determines the existence of a direct investment relationship. An effective voice in the management, as evidenced by an ownership of at least 10 per cent, implies that the direct investor is able to influence or participate in the management of an enterprise; it does not require absolute control by the foreign investor.Although not recommended by the OECD, some countries may still feel it necessary to treat the 10 per cent cut-off point in a flexible manner to fit the circumstances. In some cases, the ownership of 10 per cent of the ordinary shares or voting power may not lead to the exercise of any significant influence while, on the other hand, a direct investor may own less than 10 per cent but have an effective voice in the management. OECD does not recommend any qualifications to the 10 per cent rule. Consequently, countries that choose not to follow the 10 per cent rule in all cases should identify, where possible, the aggregate value of transactions not falling under the 10 per cent cut-off rule, so as to facilitate international comparability.Some countries may consider that the existence of elements of a direct investment relationship may be indicated by a combination of factors such as: - representation on the board of directors;- participation in policy-making processes;- material inter-company transactions;- interchange of managerial personnel;- provision of technical information;- provision of long-term loans at lower than existing market rates.Other relationships may exist between enterprises in different economies which exhibit the characteristics set out above, although there is no formal link with regard to shareholding. For example, two enterprises, each operating in different economies, may have a common board and common policy making and may share resources including funds but with neither having a shareholding in the other of 10 per cent or more. In such cases where neither is a direct investment enterprise of the other, the transactions could be treated as between related subsidiaries. These are not regarded as direct investment.BreakdownsFDI flows and positions are broken down separately as follows:-1. FDI flows1.1 FDI inflowsa) country or economic zone b) industry sector based ISIC3 (and NACE)1.2 FDI outflows a) country or economic zoneb) industry scetor based ISIC3 (and NACE)2.

          "validation": "ValuationThe OECD Benchmark Definition recommends market value as the conceptual basis for valuation. Market valuation places all assets at current prices rather than when purchased or last revalued, and allows comparability of assets of different vintages. It allows for consistency between flows and stocks of assets of different enterprises, industries, and countries, as well as over time. However, in practice book values from the balance sheets of direct investment enterprises (or investors) are generally utilised to determine the value of the stocks of direct investment. This approach reflects the fact that enterprise balance sheet values - whether they are regularly revalued on a current market value basis, reported on a historical cost basis, or are based on some interim but not current revaluation - represent the only source of valuation of assets and liabilities readily available in most countries. (In the first case, the balance sheet value is, in fact, the market value). The collection of data from enterprises on a current market value basis is to be encouraged, to narrow the gap between principle and practice."

Preferably, the end (or near-end) of the first month of the school / academic year is chosen (special arrangements are made for part-year students who may not start studies at the beginning of the school year). Students are classified as foreign students (non-citizens) if they are not citizens of the country in which the data are collected. While pragmatic and operational, this classification is inappropriate for capturing student mobility because of differing national policies regarding the naturalisation of immigrants. Countries that have lower propensity to grant permanent residence to its immigrant populations are likely to report second generation immigrants as foreign students. Therefore, for student mobility and bilateral comparisons, interpretations of data based on the concept of foreign students should be made with caution.Students are classified as international students if they left their country of origin and moved to another country for the purpose of study. Depending on country-specific immigration legislation, mobility arrangements, and data availability, international students may be defined as students who are not permanent or usual residents of their country of study or alternatively as students who obtained their prior education in a different country, including another EU country."

Data are based on water use rights and their effective use. Agriculture, forestry, fishing include data on aquaculture.Czech RepublicUp to 1995, water abstractions for fishponds were included (change of methodology - break in series). The drop in total abstractions in 2013 is explained by the lower water abstraction for cooling for electricity production.Denmark2009 - Partial totals for public water supply and manufacturing industry. Irrigation includes fish farming.EstoniaProduction of electricity - Up to 2001, data refer to total abstractions for electricity production (ISIC 35.1 Rev.4). Since 2001, data refer to the NACE activity 40.1, which means that part of the cooling water is allocated to the \"Other\" category.

Totals - Estimates including data based on partial inventories, excluding agricultural uses besides irrigation and (until 1993) electrical cooling. Agriculture - irrigation only. Manufacturing industry and electrical cooling - Data are based on partial surveys. Public supply - Before 2008, data refer to urban areas only. 1993 data include abstractions by industry. 1991 - Partial totals for public supply include manufacture and industry cooling, whereas the grand total excludes them. 2005 and 2008 - Partial data including estimates based on previous year data for abstraction by industry and electrical cooling.England and WalesSeries break in 1991 and 1999 (significant changes in reporting methods and classifications). Figures are therefore not strictly comparable with those in previous/intervening years. Public water supply includes estimations. Agriculture and irrigation - Under the Water Act 2003, abstraction of less than 20m3/day became exempt from the requirement to hold a licence as of 1 April 2005. As a result over 22,000 licences were deregulated, mainly for agriculture or private water supply purposes. However, due to the small volumes involved, this has had minimal effect on the estimated licensed and actual abstraction totals. Return requirements, which set out the actual abstraction information requested from abstractors, were standardised across England & Wales from 1 April 2008. Returns are now requested on a financial year basis. Prior to April 2008 returns were either by calendar year or financial year. To account for this, data collection for 2008 was the subject of two requests. At the end of the period January 2008 to March 2008 and at the end of the period April 2008 to March 2009. This may have had the effect of underestimating actual abstraction.OECD TotalGross freshwater abstractions per capita, as percentage of total renewable resources and as percentage of internal resources are OECD Secretariat estimates.

A criterion based on actual hours will generally yield a part-time rate higher than one based on usual hours, particularly if there are temporary reductions in working time as a result of holidays, illness, short-timing, etc. On the other hand, it is not entirely clear whether a classification based on the worker’s perception will necessarily yield estimates of part-time work that are higher or lower than one based on a fixed cut-off. In one country (France) which changed from 1981 to 1982 from a definition based on an actual hours cut-off (30 hours) to one based on the respondent’s perception, the latter criterion appeared to produce slightly higher estimates."

As of 2009, the insurance business is broken down between the business of pure life, pure non-life and composite undertakings and composite undertakings' business is further broken down between life and non-life business. Some countries do not allow for insurance undertakings to be active in both life and non-life insurance business and therefore composite insurance undertakings do not exist in these countries. In other countries (e.g., Austria, Belgium, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, Portugal, Spain) however, the share of employment in composite insurance undertakings accounts for more than half of the whole domestic insurance sector. Therefore, to have comparable data across years for life business data (resp. non-life), one has to sum up the life (resp. non-life) business of pure life (resp. non-life) undertakings and the life (resp. non-life) business of composite undertakings as of 2009."

Per capita GDP growth can be broken down into a part which is due to growth in labour productivity (GDP per hour worked) and a part which is due to increased labour utilisation (hours worked per capita). Labour productivity is a key driver of economic growth and changes in living standards, measured notably by growth in GDP per capita. Growth in labour productivity indicates a higher level of output for every hour worked. Labour productivity when measured by Unit Labour Costs (ULC) is also a key driver of international competitiveness. Data are presented as annual datapoints from 1970 onwards."

Total bilateral and multilateral exports and imports are aggregated at national or regional group level. For each reporting country or group, all the trading partners are listed. The corresponding monetary values of total imports and total exports are then provided as time series for each country/trading partner pair. All exports are valued free on board (f.o.b.). Imports are usually reported cost including insurance and freight (c.i.f.), although a small number of countries report imports f.o.b. Along with data from reporting countries, estimates are provided by partner countries for non-reporting countries or for those that are slow to report. The period for which data are available varies from country to country, but most countries data extend from the 1980s to the present. The Direction of Trade pre-1980 data is found in the DOTS Historical database which runs from 1948 to 1980. There can be inconsistencies between exports to a partner and the partner's recorded imports from a particular country, i.e. the exports from Country A to B do not always equal the imports of Country B from A. This is due to the different ways countries report their trade, i.e. differences in classification concepts and detail, time of recording, valuation, and coverage, as well as processing errors. This database was first provided by UK Data Service in December 2003. The UK Data Service web site includes further information on its IMF Direction of Trade Statistics holdings, including a dataset user guide and details of latest database updates."

Age-dependency ratios are calculated here as ratios between the number of persons potentially outside the labour force and those potentially within the labour force.The indicator \"Age dependency ratio\" is the ratio between the persons aged less than 20 (15) and those aged 65 and more over persons aged 20-64 (15-20). Two old age-dependency ratios are shown corresponding to two measures of the working age population, namely persons aged 15-64 and 20-64. The indicator \"65+share\" represents the share of 65 and over in the population. The indicator \"80+share\" represents the share of 80 and over in the population."

They include government and non-government shipments of goods, and exclude shipments between the United States and its territories and possessions, transactions with U.S. military, diplomatic and consular installations abroad, U.S. goods returned to the United States by its Armed Forces, personal and household effects of travelers, and in-transit shipments. Exports are valued at the f.a.s.- free alongside ship value of merchandise at the U.S. port of export, based on the transaction price including inland freight, insurance, and other charges incurred in placing the merchandise alongside the carrier at the U.S. port of exportation.The exporter profiles are compiled by using company identifiers or company names on export documentation to electronically link export trade data to company characteristics in the Business Register, the U.S. Census Bureau's data base of company information. The Foreign Trade Division of the U.S. Census Bureau (Census Bureau) publishes the exporter profiles. The International Trade Administration (ITA) is a partial sponsor of the work, providing both financial assistance and advice on data user needs.

They include government and non-government shipments of goods, and exclude shipments between the United States and its territories and possessions, transactions with U.S. military, diplomatic and consular installations abroad, U.S. goods returned to the United States by its Armed Forces, personal and household effects of travelers, and in-transit shipments. Exports are valued at the f.a.s.- free alongside ship value of merchandise at the U.S. port of export, based on the transaction price including inland freight, insurance, and other charges incurred in placing the merchandise alongside the carrier at the U.S. port of exportation.The exporter profiles are compiled by using company identifiers or company names on export documentation to electronically link export trade data to company characteristics in the Business Register, the U.S. Census Bureau's data base of company information. The Foreign Trade Division of the U.S. Census Bureau (Census Bureau) publishes the exporter profiles. The International Trade Administration (ITA) is a partial sponsor of the work, providing both financial assistance and advice on data user needs.

Some countries were not able to provide data distinguishing between Tertiary 1 and Tertiary 2: this was the case for Austria, France, the United Kingdom, Hungary and Japan.

          "geographicCoverage": "Geographic coverage : Country of birth With regard to the coding of countries of birth, the objective was to minimise residual (i.e. \"other\") categories. An attempt was made to preserve the maximum information available while distinguishing between continental/regional residual categories whenever this was possible (i.e. \"Other Africa\", \"Other Europe\", \"Other Asia\", \"Other South and Central America and Caribbean\", \"Other Oceania\", \"Other North America\").With regard to split, recomposed or newly constituted countries, there was little choice but to respect the coding in the national data collection, which varies from one country to another. In the United States, for example, people born in Korea have a choice of three ways to indicate their country of birth: Korea, North Korea or South Korea. More than 80% of them indicated they were born in Korea, without further specification. In the Japanese census data, it is not possible to identify in which part of the Korean peninsula a person was born; the place of birth of people born on the current territories of the Republic of Korea or the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is therefore noted \"Korea unspecified\". In the censuses of many OECD countries, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic are aggregated under the name of the former Czechoslovakia. The same applies to the former USSR and the former Yugoslavia.Regarding imprecise or missing information on the place of birth, there are two coding possibilities. For foreign-born people whose country of birth is not known or is too imprecise to fall into one of the continental categories, the country of birth is coded as Other (OTH). Since the definition of the category Other is specific to each OECD reporting country, the overall Other category does not have any particular meaning in terms of country or region of origin. For people whose birth status (native or foreign-born) is unknown, the country of birth is coded as Unknown (UNK). As can be seen in Table A.2 (see the methodological document), for most countries, the share of the population for whom the place of birth is completely undetermined is very small. However, a few countries have a significant proportion of the population with an unknown place of birth (in particular the Slovak Republic, Germany, Australia, Switzerland and New Zealand). For the OECD area as a whole, the share of people with an unknown place of birth is less than 1%.Due to confidentiality issues or imprecise information, the place of birth is sometimes recorded at the continental level instead of the country level. The detailed list of the countries and regions of birth represented in the database is provided in Table A.3 (see the methodological document).",

In File E (Detailed occupation), the underlying classification is at the sub-group level of ISCO-88 (three-digit level, 116 categories of occupation). Most countries were able to provide occupation data both at the two-digit and three-digit levels of ISCO-88. Some countries only provided data at the two-digit level. For these countries, the data are unavailable in File E. Some countries do not classify occupations using ISCO-88 but use national classifications instead. Most national classifications are close enough to ISCO-88 to allow a correct mapping at the two-digit or three-digit level, but this is not always the case. When the internal logic of the national classification is too distant from that of ISCO-88, the mapping is at best imperfect. In some (rare) cases, it is impossible to reconcile the national and international classifications, even at the one-digit level.Some European countries are using the European Community version of ISCO-88 (ISCOCOM), which differs slightly from the published ISCO-88 codes at the three-digit level. In particular, ISCO-COM has a category 247 (Public service administrative professionals) that does not exist in ISCO-88. Since the number of workers included in this category is rather large in some countries, it was decided to keep this category in the final classification.",

          "geographicCoverage": "Geographic coverage With regard to the coding of countries of birth, the objective was to minimise residual (i.e. \"other\") categories. An attempt was made to preserve the maximum information available while distinguishing between continental/regional residual categories whenever this was possible (i.e. \"Other Africa\", \"Other Europe\", \"Other Asia\", \"Other South and Central America and Caribbean\", \"Other Oceania\", \"Other North America\").With regard to split, recomposed or newly constituted countries, there was little choice but to respect the coding in the national data collection, which varies from one country to another. In the United States, for example, people born in Korea have a choice of three ways to indicate their country of birth: Korea, North Korea or South Korea. More than 80% of them indicated they were born in Korea, without further specification. In the Japanese census data, it is not possible to identify in which part of the Korean peninsula a person was born; the place of birth of people born on the current territories of the Republic of Korea or the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is therefore noted \"Korea unspecified\". In the censuses of many OECD countries, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic are aggregated under the name of the former Czechoslovakia. The same applies to the former USSR and the former Yugoslavia.Regarding imprecise or missing information on the place of birth, there are two coding possibilities. For foreign-born people whose country of birth is not known or is too imprecise to fall into one of the continental categories, the country of birth is coded as Other (OTH). Since the definition of the category Other is specific to each OECD reporting country, the overall Other category does not have any particular meaning in terms of country or region of origin. For people whose birth status (native or foreign-born) is unknown, the country of birth is coded as Unknown (UNK). As can be seen in Table A.2 (see the methodological document), for most countries, the share of the population for whom the place of birth is completely undetermined is very small. However, a few countries have a significant proportion of the population with an unknown place of birth (in particular the Slovak Republic, Germany, Australia, Switzerland and New Zealand). For the OECD area as a whole, the share of people with an unknown place of birth is less than 1%.Due to confidentiality issues or imprecise information, the place of birth is sometimes recorded at the continental level instead of the country level. The detailed list of the countries and regions of birth represented in the database is provided in Table A.3 (see the methodological document).",
          "otherCoverage": "Occupation: Key statistical conceptOccupations are recorded in the database according to the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-88, cf. ILO 1990). In File D (Occupation), the underlying classification is at the sub-major group level of ISCO-88 (two-digit level, 28 categories of occupation). In File E (Detailed occupation), the underlying classification is at the sub-group level of ISCO-88 (three-digit level, 116 categories of occupation). Most countries were able to provide occupation data both at the two-digit and three-digit levels of ISCO-88. Some countries only provided data at the two-digit level. For these countries, the data are unavailable in File E. Some countries do not classify occupations using ISCO-88 but use national classifications instead. Most national classifications are close enough to ISCO-88 to allow a correct mapping at the two-digit or three-digit level, but this is not always the case. When the internal logic of the national classification is too distant from that of ISCO-88, the mapping is at best imperfect. In some (rare) cases, it is impossible to reconcile the national and international classifications, even at the one-digit level.Some European countries are using the European Community version of ISCO-88 (ISCOCOM), which differs slightly from the published ISCO-88 codes at the three-digit level. In particular, ISCO-COM has a category 247 (Public service administrative professionals) that does not exist in ISCO-88. Since the number of workers included in this category is rather large in some countries, it was decided to keep this category in the final classification.The list of occupation groups in ISCO-88 (one-digit and two-digit levels) is reproduced in Table A.4.",

Data are further broken down by professional status - employees, total employment. Part-time employment is based on national definitions.The definition of part-time work varies considerably across OECD countries. Essentially three main approaches can be distinguished: i) a classification based on the worker's perception of his or her employment situation; ii) a cut-off (generally 30 or 35 hours per week) based on usual working hours, with persons usually working fewer hours being considered part-timers; iii) a comparable cut-off based on actual hours worked during the reference week. A criterion based on actual hours will generally yield a part-time rate higher than one based on usual hours, particularly if there are temporary reductions in working time as a result of holidays, illness, short-timing, etc. On the other hand, it is not entirely clear whether a classification based on the worker's perception will necessarily yield estimates of part-time work that are higher or lower than one based on a fixed cut-off. In one country (France) which changed from 1981 to 1982 from a definition based on an actual hours cut-off (30 hours) to one based on the respondent's perception, the latter criterion appeared to produce slightly higher estimates."

It contains a number of standardised indicators based on the central concept of “equivalised household disposable income”, i.e. the total income received by the households less the current taxes and transfers they pay, adjusted for household size with an equivalence scale. While household income is only one of the factors shaping people’s economic well-being, it is also the one for which comparable data for all OECD countries are most common. Income distribution has a long-standing tradition among household-level statistics, with regular data collections going back to the 1980s (and sometimes earlier) in many OECD countries. Achieving comparability in this field is a challenge, as national practices differ widely in terms of concepts, measures, and statistical sources. In order to maximise international comparability as well as inter-temporal consistency of data, the IDD data collection and compilation process is based on a common set of statistical conventions (e.g. on income concepts and components). The information obtained by the OECD through a network of national data providers, via a standardized questionnaire, is based on national sources that are deemed to be most representative for each country.",

Goods simply being transported through a country (goods in transit) or temporarily admitted or withdrawn (except for goods for inward or outward processing) do not add to or subtract from the stock of material resources of a country and are not included in the international merchandise trade statistics. Customs records should be the main source of the data; and the additional sources could be used where customs sources are not available. Goods should be included in statistics at the time when they enter or leave the economic territory of a country. In the case of customs-based data collection systems, the time of recording should be the date of lodgement of the customs declaration.Lists of goods to be included, to be recorded separately and to be excluded should be provided. Specific goods are to be excluded from detailed international merchandise trade statistics but recorded separately in order to derive totals of international merchandise trade for national accounts and balance of payments purposes.Trade systemThere are two trade systems in common use by which international merchandise trade statistics are compiled: general trade system and special trade system. The United Nations recommendations advise using the general trade system that provides a more comprehensive recording of external trade flows than does the special system. It also provides a better approximation of the change of ownership criterion used in the 1993 SNA and BPM5. General trade includes all goods that cross the national frontier including goods that are imported into and exported from custom-bonded warehouses and free zones. The general trade system is in use when the statistical territory of a country coincides with its economic territory so that imports include all goods entering the economic territory of a compiling country and exports include all goods leaving the economic territory of a compiling country.Special trade covers goods that cross the customs frontier plus goods that are imported into and exported from custom-bonded areas. The special trade system is in use when the statistical territory comprises only a particular part of the economic territory. Coverage of tradeThe data cover all goods which add to, or subtract from, the resources of a country as a result of their movement into or out of the country. The following types of goods are therefore included or excluded:Goods to be included in the detailed international trade statistics:- Non-monetary gold; goods traded on government account; food and other humanitarian aid; goods for military use; goods on consignment; goods used as carriers of information and software (CD-ROM, diskettes); goods for processing; returned goods; electricity, gas and water; goods under financial lease; ships, aircraft and other mobile equipment; sea products landed direct from the high seas. Goods to be excluded in the detailed international trade statistics:- Monetary gold, direct transit trade, temporary imports and exports, transactions in second-hand ships and aircraft, stores and bunkers for ships and aircraft; goods treated as part of trade in services; goods for repair.MethodologyTrade data collected by OECD mostly follow the UN recommendations. Furthermore, in European countries, two systems of data collection coexist, i.e. Extra-stats and Intrastat. Extra-EU trade statistics record movable property imported and exported by the EU Member country from and to countries outside the European community. Intra-EU trade statistics include the arrival and dispatch of movable property within the European community as recorded by each Member state of the EU.Geographical classificationThe geographical classification refers to areas of origin (or country of consignment) for imports and areas of consumption (last known destination) for exports. The statistical territory of these countries is defined in the OECD Geographical Nomenclature."

          "qualityComments": "IntrastatThe advent of the Single Market 1 January 1993, with its removal of customs formalities (the traditional source of statistical data) between Member States leads to the adoption of a specially designed collection system, Intrastat, for statistics on intra-Community trade.These changes necessitate greater vigilance on the part of statistical users because they obviously affect the nature, quality and coverage of the data. In particular, the introduction of Intrastat in 1993 involved a methodological break with the past and affected the quality of the statistics.",
          "recommendedUsesAndLimitations": "UK Data Service Guide to OECD Monthly Statistics of International TradeDifferences between OECD statistics and Community statistics of EurostatThe Monthly Statistics of International Trade now publishes data received directly from the Statistical Office of the European Communities (EUROSTAT) under the name EU15-Extra EU and EU12-Extra EU which excludes intra EU-trade.As the example below shows, Community statistics, which cover the European Union as a whole, and the statistics compiled by the EU Member States and sent to OECD, which are concerned with the national dimension, are not always directly comparable. There can be methodological differences, which make precise comparison of these statistics impossible.The principal differences are as follows:- Breakdown by partner countryFor arrivals of goods from other EU Member States, certain EU Member States record the country of origin as the partner country in their national statistics, whereas it is the EU Member State of consignment that appears in the Community statistics relating to the same goods movement. - Treatment of goods in transitSome EU Member States, particularly Belgium and the Netherlands do not record goods, which they consider to be 'in transit'. This covers, firstly, the import of goods from non-member countries which are customs cleared in these EU Member States before being dispatched on to other EU Member States and, secondly, goods from other EU Member States which are then immediately re-exported to non-member countries.These goods are normally recorded for Community Statistics purposes under intra- or extra-EU trade, as appropriate. This phenomenon is known as the 'Rotterdam effect'.- Other differencesOther methodological differences can cause discrepancies between national and Community statistics (for example: classification at national level as 'general trade' rather than 'special trade', or not recording 'repairs' on the grounds that they are considered as services)."

Patent indicators can serve to measure the output of R and D, its productivity, structure and the development of a specific technology/industry. Among the few available indicators of technology output, patent indicators are probably the most frequently used. The relationship between patents as an intermediate output resulting from R and D inputs has been investigated extensively. Patents are often interpreted as an output indicator; however, they could also be viewed as an input indicator, as patents are used as a source of information by subsequent inventors.Like any other indicator, patent indicators have many advantages and disadvantages. The advantages of patent indicators are : - patents have a close link to invention;- patents cover a broad range of technologies on which there are sometimes few other sources of data;-the contents of patent documents are a rich source of information (on the applicant, inventor, technology category, claims, etc.); and- patent data are readily available from patent offices.However, patents are subject to certain drawbacks:- the value distribution of patents is skewed as many patents have no industrial application (and hence are of little value to society) whereas a few are of substantial value;- many inventions are not patented because they are not patentable or inventors may protect the inventions using other methods, such as secrecy, lead time, etc.;- the propensity to patent differs across countries and industries;- differences in patent regulations make it difficult to compare counts across countries; and- changes in patent law over the years make it difficult to analyse trends over time.

          "variablesCollected": "Inflows and Outflows of foreign population by nationality (thousands): OECD countries seldom have tools specifically designed to measure the inflows and outflows of the foreign population, and national estimates are generally based either on population registers or residence permit data. This note is aimed at describing more systematically what is measured by each of the sources used.Flows derived from population registers (thousands):  registers can usually produce inflow and outflow data for both nationals and foreigners. To register, foreigners may have to indicate possession of an appropriate residence and/or work permit valid for at least as long as the minimum registration period. Emigrants are usually identified by a stated intention to leave the country, although the period of (intended) absence is not always specified.When population registers are used, departures tend to be less well recorded than arrivals. Indeed, the emigrant who plans to return to the host country in the future may be reluctant to inform about his departure to avoid losing rights related to the presence on the register. Registration criteria vary considerably across countries (as the minimum duration of stay for individuals to be defined as immigrants ranges from three months to one year), which poses major problems of international comparison. For example, in some countries, register data cover a portion of temporary migrants, in some cases including asylum seekers when they live in private households (as opposed to reception centres or hostels for immigrants) and international students. Flows derived from residence and/or work permits: Statistics on permits are generally based on the number of permits issued during a given period and depend on the types of permits used. The so-called “settlement countries” (Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States) consider as immigrants persons who have been granted the right of permanent residence. Statistics on temporary immigrants are also published in this database for these countries since the legal duration of their residence is often similar to long-term migration (over a year). In the case of France, the permits covered are those valid for at least one year (excluding students). Data for Italy and Portugal include temporary migrants.Another characteristic of permit data is that flows of nationals are not recorded. Some flows of foreigners may also not be recorded, either because the type of permit they hold is not tabulated in the statistics or because they are not required to have a permit (freedom of movement agreements). In addition, permit data do not necessarily reflect physical flows or actual lengths of stay since: i) permits may be issued overseas but individuals may decide not to use them, or delay their arrival; ii) permits may be issued to persons who have in fact been resident in the country for some time, the permit indicating a change of status, or a renewal of the same permit.Permit data may be influenced by the processing capacity of government agencies. In some instances a large backlog of applications may build up and therefore the true demand for permits may only emerge once backlogs are cleared.Flows estimated from specific surveysIreland provides estimates based on the results of Quarterly National Household Surveys and other sources such as permit data and asylum applications. These estimates are revised periodically on the basis of census data. Data for the United Kingdom are based on a survey of passengers entering or exiting the country by plane, train or boat (International Passenger Survey). One of the aims of this survey is to estimate the number and characteristics of migrants. The survey is based on a random sample of approximately one out of every 500 passengers. The figures were revised significantly following the latest census in each of these two countries, which seems to indicate that these estimates do not constitute an “ideal” source either. Australia and New Zealand also conduct passenger surveys which enable them to establish the length of stay on the basis of migrants’ stated intentions when they enter or exit the country. Inflows of asylum seekers by Nationality:Unit of measure used - Units.All data are based on annual submissions.Prior to 2003 data for the United Kingdom refer to number of cases, and not persons. All figures are rounded to the nearest multiple of 5.Data for the United States for 2004-2006 is a combination of INS affirmative applications and EOIR defensive applications (INS=number of cases; EOIR=number of persons).From 2003 on, data for France include unaccompanied minors.Data for Serbia might include asylum-seekers from Serbia, Montenegro, Serbia and Montenegro, and/or FR Yugoslavia.Stock of foreign-born population by country of birth:Estimates by country of birth are not available. Therefore all data presented in the International Migration Database are observed numbers. Data in italic in Table A.1.4. of the publication International Migration Outlook are estimated. For details on sources for observed figures, refer to ® below. Legend: ® Observed figures; ? Estimates with the component method (CM) or with the parametric method (PM).Two questions must be asked before examining stocks of immigrants in OECD countries: 1) Who is considered an “immigrant” in OECD countries, and 2) What are the problems related to international comparability?Who is an immigrant?There are major differences in how immigrants are defined. Some countries have traditionally focused on producing data on foreign residents (European countries, Japan and Korea) whilst others refer to the foreign-born (settlement countries, i.e. Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States). This difference in focus relates in part to the nature and history of immigration systems and legislation on citizenship and naturalisation.The foreign-born population can be viewed as representing first-generation migrants, and may consist of both foreign and national citizens. The size and composition of the foreign-born population is influenced by the history of migration flows and mortality amongst the foreign-born. For example, where inflows have been declining over time, the stock of the foreign-born will tend to age and represent an increasingly established community.The concept of foreign population may include persons born abroad who retained the nationality of their country of origin but also second and third generations born in the host country. The characteristics of the population of foreign nationals depend on a number of factors: the history of migration flows, natural increase in the foreign population and naturalisations. The nature of legislation on citizenship and the incentives foreigners have to naturalise both play a role in determining the extent to which native-born persons may or may not be foreign nationals.Sources for and problems in measuring the immigrant populationFour types of sources are used: population registers, residence permits, labour force surveys and censuses. In countries that have a population register and in those that use residence permit data, stocks and flows of immigrants are most often calculated using the same source. There are exceptions, however, as some countries instead use census or labour force survey data to estimate the stock of the immigrant population. In studying stocks and flows, the same problems are encountered whether population register or permit data are used (in particular, the risk of underestimation when minors are registered on the permit of one of the parents or if the migrants are not required to have permits because of a free movement agreement). To this must be added the difficulty of purging the files regularly to eliminate permits that have expired.Census data enable comprehensive, albeit infrequent analysis of the stock of immigrants (censuses are generally conducted every five to ten years). In addition, many labour force surveys now include questions about nationality and place of birth, thus providing a source of annual stock data. However, some care has to be taken with detailed breakdowns of the immigrant population from survey data as sample sizes can be small. Inevitably, both census and survey data may underestimate the number of immigrants, especially where they tend not to be registered for census purposes, or where they do not live in private households (labour force surveys generally do not cover those living in institutions such as reception centres and hostels for immigrants). Both these sources may detect a portion of the illegal population, which is by definition excluded from population registers and residence permit systems. Acquisition of nationality by country of former nationality (unie of measure: Units):Nationality law can have a significant impact on the measurement of the national and foreign populations. In France and Belgium, for example, where foreigners can fairly easily acquire the nationality of the host country, increases in the foreign population through immigration and births can eventually contribute to a significant rise in the population of nationals. On the other hand, in countries where naturalisation is more difficult, increases in immigration and births amongst foreigners manifest themselves almost exclusively as rises in the foreign population. In addition, changes in rules regarding naturalisation can have significant numerical effects. For example, during the 1980s, a number of OECD countries made naturalisation easier and this resulted in noticeable falls in the foreign population (and rises in the population of nationals).However, host-country legislation is not the only factor affecting naturalisation. For example, where naturalisation involves forfeiting citizenship of the country of origin, there may be incentives to remain a foreign citizen. Where the difference between remaining a foreign citizen or becoming a national is marginal, naturalisation may largely be influenced by the time and effort required to make the application, and the symbolic and political value individuals attach to being citizens of one country or another.Data on naturalisations are usually readily available from administrative sources. As with other administrative data, resource constraints in processing applications may result in a backlog of unprocessed applications which are not reflected in the figures. The statistics generally cover all means of acquiring the nationality of a country. These include standard naturalisation procedures subject to criteria such as age or residency, etc. as well as situations where nationality is acquired through a declaration or by option (following marriage, adoption or other situations related to residency or descent), recovery of former nationality and other special means of acquiring the nationality of the country). Inflows of foreign workers by nationality (unit - thousands):Most of the statistics published here are based on the number of work permits issued during the year. As was the case for overall immigration flows, the settlement countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States) consider as immigrant workers, persons who have received a permanent immigration permit for employment purposes. In each of these four countries, it is also possible to work on a temporary basis under various programmes.The data on European countries are based on initial work permits granted, which sometimes include temporary and seasonal workers. Some significant flows of workers may not be covered, either because the type of permit that they hold is not covered in these statistics, or because they do not need permits in order to work (free circulation agreements, beneficiaries of family reunification, refugees). Data for some countries may include renewals of permits. The administrative backlog in the processing of work permit applications is sometimes large (as in the United States, for example), so that the numbers recorded may bear little relation to the demand. The data may also cover initial entries into the labour market and include young foreigners born in the country who are entering the labour market. Stock of foreign-born labour force by country of birth (unit - thousands)The international comparison of “immigrant” workers faces the difficulties already mentioned earlier regarding the measurement of the overall stock of immigrants as well as to the use of different concepts of employment and unemployment.For the European countries, the main difficulty consists in covering EU nationals, who have free labour market access in EU Member States. They are sometimes issued work permits, but this information is not always as readily available as for third-country nationals. Switzerland revised the sampling of its labour-force survey in order to compensate for the information that was no longer available on EU workers in registers of foreign nationals following the signature of free movement agreements with the European Union. These bilateral agreements enable employees who are holders of “EU/EFTA” permits to change their job or profession (professional mobility), and this change is not registered in the Central Register for Foreign Nationals, the usual source for statistics on the stock of foreign workers.A simple enumeration of work permits granted may result in persons being counted more than once if the person has successively been granted two permits during the same reference period. On the other hand, holders of “permanent” residence permits allowing access to the labour market are not systematically covered, since the proportion of those who are actually working is not always known.Another difficulty concerns the inclusion of the unemployed, the self-employed and cross border workers. In the statistics of workers, the unemployed are generally included, except when the source is work permit records and when permits are granted subject to a definite job offer. The self-employed and cross-border workers are much less well covered by the statistics. Data reference periods also vary, as they are generally the end of December for register data, and the end of the first quarter of the reference year for employment survey data.Population registers (when the population in the labour force can be identified) and work permit files may show breaks in series when expired work permits are eliminated, when this is not done automatically, or when regularisation programmes are implemented. When these breaks occur, the analysis of the growth of the stock of foreign workers is significantly biased."

          "statisticalPopulation": "No data are presented on the native population, since the purpose of this database is to describe the immigrant population (generally the foreign born population). The information gathered concerns the flows and stocks of the total immigrant population and immigrant labour force, together with data on acquisition of nationality. The presentation of the series in a relatively standard format does not imply that the data have been fully standardised and are comparable at an international level, since few of the data sources used are specifically designed to record migration movements. Because of the great variety of sources used, different populations may be measured. In addition, the criteria for registering population and the conditions for granting residence permits, for example, vary across countries, which means that measurements may differ greatly even if a theoretically unique source is being used.In addition to the problem of the comparability of statistics, there is the difficulty of the very partial coverage of illegal migrants. Part of this population can be counted through censuses. Regularisation programmes, when they exist, make it possible to account for a far from negligible fraction of illegal immigrants after the fact. In terms of measurement, this makes it possible to better evaluate the volume of the foreign population at a given time, although it is not always possible to classify these immigrants according to the year they entered the country.Since the nature of the sources used differs considerably across countries, each series is provided with an explanatory note aimed at making it easier to understand and use the data presented."

Classification(s) used:JSIC Rev. 12LuxembourgSource:Service central de la statistique et des études économiques (STATEC)www.statistiques.public.lu/en/index.html Data source(s) used:The data are based on the annual survey on direct investments, which is a joint survey with the Central Bank regarding data collection in the banking sector. The survey is only exhaustive in the bank and insurance sectors. However, all large enterprises in the non-financial sector are included. Holding companies and special purpose entities are not included in the sample.  Statistical population:The data refer to majority foreign-controlled enterprises (foreign participating interests of more than 50%).Other coverage:The data are classified according to the principal industrial activity of the affiliate. Classification(s) used:NACE Revision 2Netherlands Source:Statistics Netherlands (CBS),www.cbs.nl/en-GB/default.htm?Languageswitch=on.  Data source(s) used:The ultimate controlling unit is determined on an annual basis by combining enterprise information from various sources, notably two surveys conducted by Statistics Netherlands, the Financial Statistics of Large Enterprise Groups (SFGO) and the Community Innovation Survey (CIS). However, from 2006 onwards, the UCI list of enterprises in the General Business Register (GBR), which is based on SFGO and CIS information, has been completed by the addition of information from an external source (Dun & Bradstreet database), providing a better insight into the total share of foreign enterprises in the Netherlands. In addition, a redesign of the Social Statistical Database in that year has resulted in a better match of the key indicators on employment, via the unique enterprise identifier (BEID), with the concurrent economic indicators. These improvements mean that the locus of control can now be established for over 90 percent of the total population of enterprises (with registered jobs in the Social Statistical Database) in the Netherlands. A weighting procedure was developed for the remaining share of enterprises that could not be matched to the GBR. Population & Scope:The concept of \"Ultimate controlling institutional unit of a foreign affiliate\" is adopted to classify data by country of foreign control.

Data Characteristics:The period covered is the fiscal year ending on the 31 March.The response rate to the survey is about 62%. No estimates are made for non-response. Statistical population:The survey covers enterprises in which more than one-third of the shares or holdings are owned by foreign investors. It also covers companies funded by a holding company in which more than one third of the shares or holdings is owned by foreign investors, or in which the total ratio of direct and indirect investments made by foreign investors is more than one third of the total shares. The term \"foreign investor\" refers to non-resident individuals, companies and other groups established conforming to foreign laws; or companies and other groups with its headquarter located overseas. Beginning with 2010 data, the data refer to companies that fall under the same criteria above, in which the ratio of the principal foreign investor's shares or holdings to the total capital is 50% or more. Moreover, the survey covers not only indirect investments through holding companies, but also indirect investments from all Japanese domestic companies including business corporations.

The survey is only exhaustive in the bank and insurance sectors. However, all large enterprises in the non-financial sector are included. Holding companies and special purpose entities are not included in the sample.

Classification(s) used:NACE Revision 2Netherlands Source:Statistics Netherlands (CBS),www.cbs.nl/en-GB/default.htm?Languageswitch=on.  Data source(s) used:The ultimate controlling unit is determined on an annual basis by combining enterprise information from various sources, notably two surveys conducted by Statistics Netherlands, the Financial Statistics of Large Enterprise Groups (SFGO) and the Community Innovation Survey (CIS). However, from 2006 onwards, the UCI list of enterprises in the General Business Register (GBR), which is based on SFGO and CIS information, has been completed by the addition of information from an external source (Dun & Bradstreet database), providing a better insight into the total share of foreign enterprises in the Netherlands. In addition, a redesign of the Social Statistical Database in that year has resulted in a better match of the key indicators on employment, via the unique enterprise identifier (BEID), with the concurrent economic indicators. These improvements mean that the locus of control can now be established for over 90 percent of the total population of enterprises (with registered jobs in the Social Statistical Database) in the Netherlands. A weighting procedure was developed for the remaining share of enterprises that could not be matched to the GBR. Population & Scope:The concept of \"Ultimate controlling institutional unit of a foreign affiliate\" is adopted to classify data by country of foreign control. Other coverage:The data are classified according to the principal industrial activity of the affiliate. Classification(s) used:NACE Revision 2New Zealand Source:Statistics New Zealand www.stats.govt.nz  Data source(s) used:The Statistics New Zealand Business Register (BR) is the main data source. The BR stores a range of characteristics about New Zealand enterprises, including whether an enterprise has foreign ownership, what activity/industry the enterprise is involved in, how many employees they have, and their group structure and relationships with other enterprises.  Population & Scope: The data refer to majority foreign-controlled enterprises (an overseas parent entity holds a shareholding greater than 50 percent). Geographic coverage:The concept of \"Ultimate controlling institutional unit of a foreign affiliate\" is adopted to classify data by country of foreign control. Sector coverage:All industries are covered. Other coverage:The data are classified according to the principal industrial activity of the affiliate. Classification(s) used:ANZSIC 2006NorwaySource: Statistics Norway www.ssb.no/english/ Data source(s) used:Statistics Norway's Structural Business Statistics are the main data source (no separate data collection for statistics on foreign-controlled enterprises). In order to define which companies are controlled from abroad, the register of foreign assets and liabilities in Norway (the SIFON register) and the balance of payments reporting are used. The Directorate of Taxes' register of shareholders has been the main source for updating the SIFON register. The press and Internet etc. are also used to map new foreign-controlled enterprises in Norway, and to map the ultimate country of ownership.Name of collection/source:The results are published every year on the website of Statistics Norway at www.ssb.no/utfono_en/. Statistical population:The statistics cover majority foreign-controlled enterprises in Norway, i.e. subsidiaries that are controlled either directly or indirectly by an enterprise abroad (ownership interest of more than 50%). Only active enterprises are included in the population. Geographic coverage:The concept of \"Ultimate controlling institutional unit of a foreign affiliate\" is adopted to classify data by country of foreign control.

They include government and non-government shipments of goods, and exclude shipments between the United States and its territories and possessions, transactions with U.S. military, diplomatic and consular installations abroad, U.S. goods returned to the United States by its Armed Forces, personal and household effects of travelers, and in-transit shipments. Exports are valued at the f.a.s.- free alongside ship value of merchandise at the U.S. port of export, based on the transaction price including inland freight, insurance, and other charges incurred in placing the merchandise alongside the carrier at the U.S. port of exportation.The exporter profiles are compiled by using company identifiers or company names on export documentation to electronically link export trade data to company characteristics in the Business Register, the U.S. Census Bureau's data base of company information.

The higher level (Territorial Level 2) consists of about 362 macro-regions while the lower level (Territorial Level 3) is composed of 1802 micro-regions.This classification - which, for European countries, is largely consistent with the Eurostat classification - facilitates greater comparability of regions at the same territorial level. The differences with the Eurostat NUTS classification concern Belgium, Greece and the Netherlands where the NUTS 2 level correspond to the OECD TL3 and Germany where the NUTS1 corresponds to the OECD TL2 and the OECD TL3 corresponds to 97 spatial planning regions (Groups of Kreise). For the United Kingdom the Eurostat NUTS1 corresponds to the OECD TL2.Due to limited data availability, labour market indicators in Canada and Australia are presented for a different grid (groups of TL3 regions in the case of Canada). Since these breakdowns are not part of the OECD official territorial grids, for the sake of simplicity they are labelled as Non Official Grids (NOG).Summarising: for each OECD country, data are collected at two sub-national levels:Territorial level 2 (TL2), which refers to the 362 large regions of the OECD area.Territorial Level 3 (TL3), which refers to the 1802 small regions of the OECD area."

Land under vines and trees and shrubs producing fruits, nuts and flowers, such as roses and jasmine, is also classified, as are nurseries (except those for forest trees, which should be classified under \"forests and other wooded land\").Arable and permanent cropland is defined as the sum of arable area and land under permanent crops.Permanent meadows and pastures refer to land used for five years or more to grow herbaceous forage crops, either cultivated or growing wild (wild prairie or grazing land).Forest refers to land spanning more than 0.5 hectare (50m2) and a canopy cover of more than 10%, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ.

The dataset also includes the OECD's leading indicators (key variables that signal changes in the business cycle).The OECD defines each variable separately for each country. Nevertheless, the data are considered sufficiently similar to enable comparisons between countries, especially for relative values and rates of change.These data were first provided by the UK Data Service in January 2003.

          "keyStatisticalConcept": "The data presented come from the OECD pilot database on material flows, and from other national and international sources.The definitions used are based on the OECD Guide \"Measuring material flows and resource productivity\" and on ongoing international work on material Flow Accounting and Analysis (MFA).It should be borne in mind that the data should be interpreted with caution and that the time series presented here may change in future as work on methodologies for MF accounting progresses. Furthermore, data contain rough estimates for OECD and BRIICS aggregates.These data refer to material resources, i.e. materials originating from natural resources that form the material basis of the economy: Metals (ferrous and non-ferrous), non-metallic minerals (construction minerals and industrial minerals), biomass (wood and food), and fossil energy carriers.The use of materials in production and consumption processes has many economic, social and environmental consequences. These consequences often extend beyond the borders of countries or regions, notably when materials are traded internationally, either in the form of raw materials or as products embodying them. They differ among the various materials and among the various stages of the resource life cycle (extraction, processing, use, transport, end-of-life management). From an environmental point of view, these consequences depend on:The rate of extraction and depletion of renewable and non-renewable resource stocks. The extent of harvest and the reproductive capacity and natural productivity of renewable resources. The associated environmental burden (e.g. pollution, waste, habitat disruption), and its effects on environmental quality (e.g. air, water, soil, biodiversity, landscape) and on related environmental services.These data inform about physical flows of material resources at various levels of detail and at various stages of the flow chain. The information shows:The material basis of economies and its composition by major material groups, considering: The extraction of raw materials The trade balance in physical terms The consumption of materials The material inputs The consumption of selected materials that are of environmental and economic significance. In-use stocks of selected products that are of environmental and economic significance.Domestic Extraction Used (DEU) refers to the flows of raw materials extracted or harvested from the environment and that physically enter the economic system for further processing or direct consumption (they are used by the economy as material factor inputs).Unused Domestic Extraction (UDE) exclude excavated soil for construction purposes and soil erosion from agricultural land. The main reason is that excavated soil is commonly not reported in statistics, and estimation methods are not well-developed.Imports (IMP) and Exports (EXP) are major components of the direct material flow indicators DMI (Domestic Material Input) and DMC (Domestic Material Consumption). They cannot be taken as indication of domestic resource requirements.Indirect Flows of Imports (IFIMP) and Indirect Flows of Exports (IFEXP) indicate the magnitude of global primary materials resource requirements associated with these flows. They thus indicate a generic environmental pressure caused by foreign resource requirements.Physical Trade Balance (PTB) refers to the trade surplus or deficit of an economy, which is defined as Imports minus Exports of raw materials and manufactured products.Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) refers to the amount of materials directly used in an economy, which refers to the apparent consumption of materials. DMC is computed as DEU minus Exports plus Imports.Domestic Material Input (DMI) is computed as DEU plus Imports.Total Material Requirements (TMR) is computed as DMI plus IFIMP plus UDE.Total Material Consumption (TMC) is computed as DMC plus UDE plus Physical Trade Balance of Indirect Flows (IFPTB).Total Material Requirement (TMR) and Total Material Consumption (TMC) exclude the components of (domestic) earth/soil excavation and dredging, and the (domestic) soil erosion from agricultural land.The material groups are:Food: Food crops (e.g. cereals, roots, sugar and oil bearing crops, fruits, vegetables), fodder crops (including grazing), wild animals (essentially marine catches), small amounts of non-edible biomass (e.g. fibres, rubber), and related products including livestock. Wood: Harvested wood and traded products essentially made of wood (paper, furniture, etc.). Construction minerals: Non-metallic construction minerals whether primary (e.g. sand, gravel, stones, limestone, excavated soil if used) or processed (e.g. glass, cement, concrete). Industrial minerals: Non-metallic industrial minerals whether primary or processed (e.g. salts, arsenic, potash, phosphate rocks, sulphates, asbestos). Metals: Metal ores, metals and products mainly made of metals. Fossil fuel: Coal, crude oil, natural gas and peat, as well as manufactured products predominantly made of fossil fuels (e.g. plastics, synthetic rubber)."

Revisions are mainly due to the implementation of the classification NACE Rev.2 by European countries into their national accounts, the change of reference year in some OECD member countries, along with the possible implementation of other methodological changes.These changes can impact on output and/or labour input at the whole economy level, and can also have an effect on the growth in Multi-factor productivity (see MFP dataset under Productivity theme); therefore, care should be taken when using the productivity estimates hereafter. Labour productivity is defined as GDP per hour worked.Underlying series of Gross Domestic Product refer to GDP in national currency, at constant prices, OECD base year 2005 for each country; and to GDP, in US dollars, at constant prices, constant PPPs, OECD base year 2005 for country groups / zones.Labour input is defined as total hours worked by all persons engaged. The data are derived as average hours worked (from the OECD Employment Outlook, OECD Annual National Accounts, OECD Labour Force Statistics and national sources) multiplied by the corresponding and consistent measure of employment for each particular country.The measures of labour productivity are presented as indices and as rates of change (see graphic hereafter on LP growth per country).Main data sources used are: OECD Annual National Accounts, OECD Employment Outlook, OECD Labour Force Statistics and some national sources.Underlying sources used for estimating employment and hours worked data are summarized in the document below.",

          "statisticalPopulation": "Australia: Foreign affiliates refers to enterprises that are majority owned by Australian resident enterprises (more than 50% of the ordinary shares or voting stock). This includes offshore subsidiaries, branches and majority-owned foreign joint ventures. There were 30 finance and insurance Australian resident parent enterprises that reported on behalf of all their finance and insurance foreign affiliates. The SOFI FATS population was obtained by using the survey population from two related ABS surveys: the Survey of International Investment and the Survey of International Trade in Services, supplemented by additional units that were identified as in scope. Austria: The data refer to foreign affiliates of Austrian controlled domestic enterprises (participating interests of more than 50%). The multiple minority ownership is considered. Indirectly controlled foreign affiliates are included. The concept of \"Ultimate controlling institutional unit of a foreign affiliate\" is adopted to identify the relevant target population. Other data characteristics:Regarding direct affiliates, only enterprises above a threshold of EUR 100 000 for equity ownership and with a balance sheet of more than EUR 10 million are included. Indirect affiliates with at least 20 persons employed or with a balance sheet of more than EUR 10 million are also included. No estimates are made for any entities not included in the survey. Consequently, the Austrian outward FATS data are subject to an unknown degree of underreporting, but underreporting probably has a material impact only on one variable, namely the number of enterprises. Belgium: Reporting units above a threshold of EUR 15 million for equity and with a balance sheet total of more than EUR 25 million are included in the survey population. No estimates are made for any entities not included in the survey and for non-response. Canada: The data refer to foreign affiliates majority-owned (i.e. more than 50% of the voting shares) by a business that resides in Canada. Foreign affiliates indirectly controlled by the parent company are not taken into consideration. The concept of \"Ultimate controlling institutional unit of a foreign affiliate\" has not been used to identify the relevant target population. The BP-59 questionnaire (Capital invested abroad by Canadian enterprises), which contains some questions on foreign affiliates as well as other questions about Canadian investment abroad, is sent to Canadian enterprises with at least CAD 2 to 5 million in investment abroad (depending on the country/region). Roughly 1 800 firms receive the BP-59 questionnaire, about half of which are surveyed annually and the other half of which are surveyed once every 3 years. The survey is believed to cover close to 100% of the target population. For operational reasons, depository institutions and foreign branches of firms were excluded from the estimates.Czech Republic: The data refer to foreign affiliates controlled by Czech ultimate controlling institutional units (participating interests of more than 50%). Multiple minority ownership is not considered. Data for joint ventures are not included. Indirectly controlled foreign affiliates are included up to the first level of indirect ownership (an affiliate of an affiliate of domestic direct investor company). Affiliates abroad of resident parent companies under foreign control are excluded from the population.The data are prepared by the Czech National Bank (CNB), on the basis of a yearly statistical survey on flows and stocks of direct investment abroad. The ownership is stated at the end of the reference year and there are no thresholds considered. The register of resident direct investors is updated based on companies' reports of direct investment transactions (reporting obligation under the Foreign Exchange Law), business register, public sources and commercial sources.Denmark: The data come from an annual survey (Danish Foreign Affiliates) with no cut-off threshold. The population of enterprises is formed from different sources notably the Foreign Direct Investment Register of the Danish Central Bank, annual company reports and commercial data sources. Information regarding the Danish parent enterprise is from the Statistics Denmark's Business Register.Other data characteristics: The statistical results in principle cover every foreign affiliate to all relevant Danish parent enterprises. No sample survey technique or cut-off limit has been introduced. The census approach implies that around 3 500 Danish parent enterprises covering approximately 11 000 foreign affiliates are covered. The response rate is relatively high, 96% in 2010. There is no compensation for non-response in the results.The data refer to foreign affiliates that are controlled by the parent enterprise. The parent enterprise is considered having the control if it, directly or indirectly, owns more than 50% of the capital or has a controlling influence. Foreign affiliates owned by enterprises registered in Denmark but ultimately owned from abroad have been excluded from the population.Finland: Statistics on Finnish affiliates abroad produce annual data on the number, activities and location of Finnish enterprises' units abroad. A unit located abroad may be an affiliate (ownership over 50%), a branch, a joint venture (co-owned 50%-50% with another enterprise) or an associated company (ownership at least 10% but under 50%). The inquiry is filled in by each group head resident in Finland who controls at least 10% of the voting power directly or via other enterprises in affiliates located abroad. The data concern the group's affiliates abroad. France: The survey is addressed to all groups whose main decision center is located in France and controlling at least one unit located abroad. A unit located abroad may be an affiliate (direct or indirect holding of over 50% of the voting rights), a branch or a joint venture (jointly controlled with another group). Associated companies (minority participation between 20 and 50%) are not covered. Germany: The data are based on annual stock surveys of direct investment (residents' assets in foreign economic territories), which cover all enterprises abroad directly or indirectly owned by German investors through German majority-owned enterprises abroad.The submission of reports is required for direct investment enterprises abroad with a balance sheet total exceeding EUR 3 million.No estimates are made for any entities not included in the survey. The data refer to foreign affiliates majority-owned by German firms. Only majority investments are included if the German direct investor is not controlled by another foreign investor (German direct investor is the ultimate controlling institutional unit). Joint ventures (50/50 ownership) are considered. In the case of joint ventures between a national owner and a foreign owner, ownership is not included in the following figures (only national majority-owned affiliates by definition). In the case of joint ventures between two national owners, national ownership is included in the following figures. Multiple minority ownership is also considered.Greece: The data are collected from the annual FDI stock survey carried out by the Balance of Payments Statistics Department of the Bank of Greece. Data from balance of payments transactions and press reports are used as a supplementary source. No thresholds are considered for the survey.The concept of \"ultimate controlling institutional unit of a foreign affiliate\" is adopted to identify the relevant target population.Hungary: The adequate information to define the target population came from FDI questionnaires. The FDI Register based on the FDI survey contains the contact information of reported units and statistical units as well. It also contains some information about the equity capital of mother company in the foreign affiliates. The concept of \"ultimate controlling institutional unit of a foreign affiliate\" is adopted to identify the relevant target population. The data come from a special statistical survey of the HCSO, and also from a test questionnaire by the National Bank of Hungary (NBH). In the HCSO survey there is a threshold: reporting units with less than EUR 40 000 of direct investment from the parent company are not included in the observed population. The results are not grossed up.The response rate is about 50%. No estimates have been made for non-response.The data refer to foreign affiliates majority-owned by Hungarian firms, i.e. enterprises with a Hungarian participation of more than 50% in voting shares.Ireland: About 500 Irish multinationals have been surveyed in 2010, which is very close to a full target population. The response rate was 76%. Due to the high response rate among the largest Irish multinationals, it is felt that the issue of non-response does not overly affect the final results. The data refer to foreign affiliates majority-owned by Irish firms, i.e. enterprises with an Irish participation of more than 50% in voting shares.Israel: The statistical data for Israel are supplied by and under the responsibility of the relevant Israeli authorities. The use of such data by the OECD is without prejudice to the status of the Golan Heights, East Jerusalem and Israeli settlements in the West Bank under the terms of international law.Italy: The main data source is the information available from the annual and consolidated account reports of incorporated companies, and more particularly the list of participations included in their Annex. It is then integrated with other information available at ISTAT: administrative data, statistical business files and structural business surveys. The target population is identified using the Business register and the EGR (EuroGroups Register).Estimates have been made for non-responders, notably using the commercial ORBIS database (from Bureau Van Dijk).Japan: The survey covers all Japanese firms having at least one affiliate abroad. An \"overseas affiliate\" means either a foreign affiliate (subsidiary) in which a Japanese corporation has invested capital of 10% or more, or a foreign affiliate (sub-subsidiary) in which a \"subsidiary\", funded more than 50% by a Japanese corporation, has invested capital of more than 50%.The following notes apply to all variables: •Textiles, wearing apparel, leather and related products (13-15) includes Manufacture of man-made fibres (2030).•Printing and reproduction of recorded media (18) excludes Reproduction of recorded media (1820).•Chemicals and chemical products (20) excludes Manufacture of man-made fibres (2030).•Basic metals (24) includes Manufacture of other electronic and electric wires and cables (2732)•Computer, electronic and optical products (26) excludes Manufacture of watches and clocks (2652).•Electrical equipment (27) includes part of Manufacture of measuring, testing, navigating and control equipment (2651); excludes Manufacture of other electronic and electric wires and cables (2732).•Machinery and equipment n.e.c. (28) excludes Manufacture of ovens, furnaces and furnace burners (2815).•Wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles (45-47) excludes Maintenance and repair of motor vehicles (4520).•Information service activities (63) excludes News agency activities (6391) and part of Data processing, hosting and related activities (6311).•Financial and insurance activities (64-66) excludes Activities of holding companies (6420).•Education (85) excludes Educational support activities (8550).Korea: The data cover both minority and majority participations (at least 10% in voting shares). Firms indirectly controlled by the parent company are not included. The concept of \"ultimate controlling institutional unit of a foreign affiliate\" has not been used to identify the relevant target population. Reporting units with less than USD one million of direct investment from the parent company were not included in the target population.Luxembourg: The data are based on the annual survey on direct investments, which is a joint survey with the Central Bank regarding data collection in the banking sector. The survey is only exhaustive in the bank and insurance sectors. However, all large enterprises in the non-financial sector are included. Special purpose entities (holding companies) are not covered. A resident enterprise included in the sample is surveyed if it holds directly or indirectly one or several subsidiaries, associate companies or branches abroad. The data refer to foreign affiliates directly or indirectly majority-controlled (more than 50%) by the national parent company.Netherlands: Data come from a survey covering large non-financial enterprises. Administrative sources have been used for smaller non-financial enterprises and largest financial companies. The information used to define the target population come from the enterprise group register and also from annual reports.Reporting units with more than EUR 23 million total assets are surveyed. The results are grossed up to the whole population.The target population consists of almost all companies active in the Netherlands, for which the UCI is in the Netherlands and having subsidiaries outside the EU.Norway: The statistics are based on Statistics Norway's own collection of reports on investment abroad, which is a joint collection with direct investment abroad (outward FDI). The reports provide information about the foreign enterprises, including what the Norwegian enterprise owns, accounting information on investment and revenue, and information on turnover and employment. In addition, information is used from the annual report submitted to the Register of Company Accounts in Brønnøysund, information from the media, Internet etc. to map the changes in investment abroad. These sources are also used to map the Norwegian ultimate owner country (the country where the enterprise in the ownership chain that is not controlled by another enterprise is located).The statistics are based on a cut-off sampling survey. The sampling survey covers the largest Norwegian enterprises with activity abroad. In addition, a sample of smaller enterprises is drawn. The statistics cover, in principle, all Norwegian-controlled enterprises abroad, i.e. subsidiaries in foreign countries that are controlled either directly or indirectly by an enterprise in Norway through an ownership interest of more than 50%. Only economically active enterprises are included in the population.Poland: The data come from the Enterprise Department of the Central Statistical Office of Poland (CSO). They have been collected from the annual statistical survey on entities having abroad branches, establishments or shares in other companies, covering all enterprises regardless of number of employees.The data refer to majority controlled affiliates abroad, where more than 50% of the capital and voting shares is held by one resident, including those that are ultimately controlled by foreign investors. Indirectly controlled affiliates are included. The concept of \"ultimate controlling institutional unit of a foreign affiliate\" is adopted to identify the relevant target population. Portugal: The data refer to foreign affiliates majority-owned by Portuguese enterprises (participating interests of more than 50%). Majority investments are included if the Portuguese direct investor is not controlled by another foreign investor, i.e. Portuguese direct investor is the ultimate controlling institutional unit. All foreign affiliates directly or indirectly controlled by Portuguese parent companies are considered.Slovak Republic: The data are compiled on the basis of statistical surveys organised by the Slovak statistical office. A special module is included into annual structural business surveys. All active enterprises with 20 and more employees are included in the survey.The data refer to foreign affiliates majority-owned by Slovak firms. Firms indirectly controlled by the Slovak parent company are included only in respect of majority (50%) interests. Only resident owners which are not foreign-controlled themselves are considered. Joint ventures are considered. In the case of equally shared control (50/50), all values are allocated to the country of residence of the affiliate abroad.Spain: Primary information is generated from the Register of Foreign Investments of the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade (MITyC). This register is formed from the declarations forms on foreign investment compiled by the General Directorate for Trade and Investments. These data have been complemented with information from the EuroGroups Register.Statistical units above a threshold of EUR 1.5 million for net assets are covered. The results are grossed up to the whole population using the EuroGroups Register. The data refer to affiliates abroad of parent companies majority-owned (more than 50%) by Spaniard parent companies. The concept of \"Ultimate controlling institutional unit of a foreign affiliate\" is adopted to identify the relevant target population. Information is collected up to the third level in the chain of participation.United Kingdom: The target population is identified using the EGR (EuroGroups Register).The statistical population includes 200 enterprise groups with the largest number of affiliates having UK UCI (50% of the sample population). The results are grossed up for not-surveyed affiliates, using sample returns, the business register and the EGR.United States: The data are based on on annual and benchmark surveys which cover all affiliates of all US parents (all non-bank affiliates of non-bank US parents up to 2008).All foreign affiliates in which the combined direct and indirect ownership interest of all US parents exceeds 10% are covered by the survey. However, in order to reduce respondent burden, most of the detailed data are only collected on majority-owned affiliates (those affiliates in which the combined direct and indirect ownership interest of all US parents exceeds 50%). The data in this publication relate to majority-owned affiliates.Data for the Asia area actually correspond to those of Asia-Pacific excluding Australia.The following notes apply to all variables: •Other manufacturing; repair and installation of machinery and equipment (31 to 33) excludes Repair and installation of machinery and equipment (33).•Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities (36 to 39) excludes Waste management and remediation activities (38 to 39).•Total services (45 to 96) exclude Monetary intermediation (641) up to 2008.•Wholesale and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles (45) is included in Wholesale trade (46) and Retail trade (47).•Wholesale trade (46) includes part of Wholesale and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles (45).•Retail trade (47) includes part of Wholesale and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles (45).•Financial and insurance activities (64-66) excludes Monetary intermediation (641) up to 2008.•Administrative and support service activities (77 to 82) and Other administrative and support service activities (78 to 82) include Waste management and remediation activities (38 to 39).•Total business sector (9999) excludes Monetary intermediation (641) up to 2008."

The priority date is considered to be closest to the actual date of invention Variables - percentage of co-inventions developed within-country (all inventors from the same country), percentage with foreign inventors, percentage with inventors only from OECD countries, percentage of co-inventions with at least one inventor from BRIICS countries. Technology domain - based on the ENV-TECH definitions. Indicator of technology diffusion: The number of inventions that seek patent protection through national, regional or international routes (equivalents of the priority application, pertaining to the same \"simple patent family\") in a given jurisdiction. It shows the extent to which firms and individuals seek to \"protect\" the relevant markets for their inventions (including both domestic and foreign inventions). The indicator is disaggregated by: Patent office - integer counts of patent applications deposited in different geographic jurisdictions (national and regional application authorities) Application date - the date of filing of a patent application with a given patent office Coverage - allows displaying statistics based on all available data (\"full dataset, with no restriction on coverage\") or only for offices with data availability above a certain threshold (90%) in a given year (\"conservative coverage\").  While for most OECD countries data availability is complete, this distinction might be important particularly for some non-OECD countries; low coverage might underestimate actual performance. Coverage is estimated as the proportion of months in a year with the evidence of at least one patent document deposited at the patent office, based on the bibliographic information provided by the EPO concerning the contents of the master database from which PATSTAT is drawn Technology domain - based on the ENV-TECH definitions. N.B. Counts for aggregate technological domains are provided separately to avoid double-counting of inventions. For example, the count of \"selected environment-related technologies\" is lesser or equal to the sum of its sub-components ('environmental management', 'water-related adaptation' and 'climate change mitigation'). This is because patents are commonly classified in more than one technology class. Therefore each patent (invention) is counted only once when aggregating across technological domains.",

Patent indicators can serve to measure the output of R and D, its productivity, structure and the development of a specific technology/industry. Among the few available indicators of technology output, patent indicators are probably the most frequently used.

Patents are often interpreted as an output indicator; however, they could also be viewed as an input indicator, as patents are used as a source of information by subsequent inventors.Like any other indicator, patent indicators have many advantages and disadvantages. The advantages of patent indicators are :- patents have a close link to invention; patents cover a broad range of technologies on which there are sometimes few other sources of data;- the contents of patent documents are a rich source of information (on the applicant, inventor, technology category, claims, etc.); and- patent data are readily available from patent offices.However, patents are subject to certain drawbacks:- the value distribution of patents is skewed as many patents have no industrial application (and hence are of little value to society) whereas a few are of substantial value;- many inventions are not patented because they are not patentable or inventors may protect the inventions using other methods, such as secrecy, lead time, etc.;- the propensity to patent differs across countries and industries;- differences in patent regulations make it difficult to compare counts across countries; and- changes in patent law over the years make it difficult to analyse trends over time.

They are consistent across time and countries. Users of the data must be aware that they may no longer fully reflect the current situation in fast reforming countries. The indicators cover formal regulations in the following areas: state control of business enterprises; legal and administrative barriers to entrepreneurship; barriers to international trade and investment. Not all data are available for all countries for all years."

Sometimes, secondary sources such as OECD Annual Labour Force Statistics and OECD Economic Outlook can be used..Estimates of productivity levels are more uncertain than estimates of productivity growth; therefore, those measures should be interpreted with caution.",

The OECD productivity by industry database is a consistent dataset of productivity measures that is to be added to the OECD productivity for the total economy database, aiming to widen analytical studies for industrial activities.The estimates of MFP by industry are consistent with MFP computed at the aggregate level with the following approaches:- Solow residual using cost share- Geometric depreciation rate- Exogenous rate of return (ex-ante approach)- Coverage of all economic activities excluding activity related to residential construction.Due to the lack of data on investment by industry and by asset, which is a major requirement to obtain capital services series as a measure for capital input in the OECD productivity at the total economy level, the estimates of MFP at industry level is computed using net capital stocks."

Data on government sector receipts, and on taxes in particular, are basic inputs to most structural economic descriptions and economic analyses and are increasingly used in international comparisons. These databases give a conceptual framework to define which government receipts should be regarded as taxes and to classify different types of taxes. They present a unique set of detailed and internationally comparable tax data in a common format for all OECD countries from 1955 onwards. This dataset contains gross domestic product (GDP) statistics in millions of national currency at market prices, population statistics, and exchange rates in national currency per U.S. dollar."

TL3 regions are further classified as predominantly urban (PU), predominantly rural (PR) and intermediate (IN). All the territorial units are defined within national borders, and each TL3 region is contained in one TL2 region, with the exception of the United States and one region in Germany (Ost-Friesland DE12). National values have been computed based on regional estimates. For this reason, it is possible that in some cases these values differ from national statistics.",

This classification - which, for European countries, is largely consistent with the Eurostat classification - facilitates greater comparability of regions at the same territorial level. The differences with the Eurostat NUTS classification concern Belgium, Greece and the Netherlands where the NUTS 2 level correspond to the OECD TL3 and Germany where the NUTS1 corresponds to the OECD TL2 and the OECD TL3 corresponds to 97 spatial planning regions (Groups of Kreise). For the United Kingdom the Eurostat NUTS1 corresponds to the OECD TL2.Due to limited data availability, labour market indicators in Canada are presented for a different grid (groups of TL3 regions). Since these breakdowns are not part of the OECD official territorial grids, for the sake of simplicity they are labelled as Non Official Grids (NOG)."

The set of indicators selected to measure these dimensions is a combination of people's individual attributes and their local conditions, and in most cases, are available over two different years (2000 and 2014). Regions can be easily visualised and compared to other regions through the interactive website [www.oecdregionalwellbeing.org]. The dataset, the website and the publications \"Regions at a Glance\" and \"How’s life in your region?\" are outputs designed from the framework for regional and local well-being. The Regional income distribution dataset presents comparable data on sub-national differences in income inequality and poverty for OECD countries. The data by region provide information on income distribution within regions (Gini coefficients and income quintiles), and relative income poverty (with poverty thresholds set in respect of the national population) for 2013. These new data complement international assessments of differences across regions in living conditions by documenting how household income is distributed within regions and how many people are poor relatively to the typical citizen of their country."

The territorial grids used in this database are officially established and relatively stable in all member countries, and are used by many as a framework for implementing regional policies. Regions in OECD Member Countries have been classified according to two territorial levels (TL). The higher level (Territorial Level 2) consists of about 362 macro-regions while the lower level (Territorial Level 3) is composed of 1802 micro-regions.This classification - which, for European countries, is largely consistent with the Eurostat classification - facilitates greater comparability of regions at the same territorial level. The differences with the Eurostat NUTS classification concern Belgium, Greece and the Netherlands where the NUTS 2 level correspond to the OECD TL3 and Germany where the NUTS1 corresponds to the OECD TL2 and the OECD TL3 corresponds to 97 spatial planning regions (Groups of Kreise). For the United Kingdom the Eurostat NUTS1 corresponds to the OECD TL2.Due to limited data availability, labour market indicators in Canada and Australia are presented for a different grid (groups of TL3 regions in the case of Canada). Since these breakdowns are not part of the OECD official territorial grids, for the sake of simplicity they are labelled as Non Official Grids (NOG).Summarising: for each OECD country, data are collected at two sub-national levels:Territorial level 2 (TL2), which refers to the 362 large regions of the OECD area.Territorial Level 3 (TL3), which refers to the 1802 small regions of the OECD area."

In this Revision 1 of the database, estimates of imports and exports of goods are provided for the time-period 1990-2011 for all reporters but three (subject to the availability of underlying product-based annual trade statistics as of mid-September 2012). The list of reporters covers all OECD Member Countries and 30 non member economies, including the BRIICS (Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, Indonesia, China and South Africa). It should be noted that underlying series for OECD countries are from OECD International Trade by Commodity Statistics., while data for non OECD economies are from UNSD database COMTRADE. The list of partners covers all 34 OECD countries, 30 non member economies, the Rest of the World, the partner Unspecified, and Total World.

The ANBERD database includes a number of estimations and is published under the responsibility of the Secretary General of the OECD as it does not represent Member countries’ official submissions of business enterprise RandD data. The current version of the ANBERD database presents industrial RandD expenditure data broken down in up to 100 manufacturing and services sectors for OECD countries and selected non-member economies from 1987 onwards. For the first time, the reported data are in ISIC Revision 4 and are expressed in national currencies as well as in PPP US dollars, both at current and constant prices. The ANBERD data are updated continuously on a rolling basis and additional countries will be included in the coming months as they become available."

The process includes the following. The population data from national censuses and national statistical offices are adjusted for mid-year (July 1st) assuming constant growth rate between two data points. For the years to which census or national data are not available, the population figures are interpolated or extrapolated. For interpolation, the constant growth rate between the two data points is assumed. For extrapolation, the same growth rate as the average of earliest (or latest) 3 years is used. Then the share of each admin 1 population to the sum of all admin 1 areas is calculated. If there is only one data point, it is assumed that the share of admin 1 population to the total population remains constant. Admin 1 population estimates (absolute numbers) are then calculated by applying the share of each admin 1 to total population of the World Bank's World Development Indicators' total population estimates.While estimating admin 1 population the latest admin 1 classification for which data is available was used for each country.

The latest version is based on calculations for the Average Worker (AW) in the private sector (see glossary term), and the results are shown for 8 household types covering one- and two-earner families of varying size and different fractions of average gross wage earnings. There are 14 separate tax burden measures that describe the tax and benefit position of these families.This approach was first followed in the 2005-2006 Taxing Wages publication, which also applied these assumptions to calculate tax burden measures as of 2000. These assumptions have been applied since then in the more recent Taxing Wages publications and website databases.The first version of the Taxing Wages model (historical model A) was based on a more narrow definition of the average worker: the Average Production Worker (APW) solely from the manufacturing sector (see glossary term). It included only two of the current 8 family types, and the results are shown for only 3 of the existing 14 tax burden measures. This model was applied to data for years 1979-2004.The second version (historical model B) continued to use the Average Production Worker (APW) basis for its calculations, but was expanded to cover the full 8 family types that are currently used, and increased the number of tax burden measures to 12 of the 14 currently used. This model was applied to data for years 1997-2004.",

          "recommendedUsesAndLimitations": "UK Data Service Guide to OECD Tax StatisticsThe simple approach of comparing the tax/benefit position of example households avoids many of the conceptual and definitional problems involved in more complex international comparisons of tax burdens and transfer programmes. However, a drawback of this methodology is that the earnings of an average worker will usually occupy a different position in the overall income distribution in different economies, although the earnings relate to workers in similar jobs in various OECD Member countries.Because of the limitations on the taxes and benefits covered in the Report, the data cannot be taken as an indication of the overall impact of the government sector on the welfare of taxpayers and their families. Complete coverage would require studies of the impact of indirect taxes, the treatment of non-wage labour income and other income components under personal income taxes and the effect of other tax allowances and cash benefits. Complete coverage would also require that consideration be given to the effect on welfare of services provided by the state, either free or below cost, and the incidence of corporate and other direct taxes on earnings and prices. Such a broad coverage is not possible in an international comparison of all OECD countries. The differences between the results shown here and those of a full study of the overall impact on employees of government interventions in the economy would vary from one country to another. They would depend on the relative shares of different kinds of taxes in government revenues and on the scope and nature of government social expenditures.The Report shows only the formal incidence of taxes on employees and employers. The final, economic incidence of taxes may be quite different, because the tax burden may be shifted from employers onto employees and vice versa by market adjustments to gross wages.The income left at the disposal of a taxpayer may represent different standards of living in various countries because the range of goods and services on which the income is spent and their relative prices differ as between countries. In those countries where the general government sector provides a wide range of goods and services (generous basic old age pension, free health services, public housing, university education, etcetera), the taxpayer may be left with less cash income but may enjoy the same living standards as a taxpayer receiving a higher cash income but living in a country where there are fewer publicly provided goods and services."

Some were updated or revised on the basis of comments from national Delegates and in the framework of the OECD Environmental Performance Reviews.When interpreting these data, it should be borne in mind that the number of species known does not always accurately reflect the number of species in extistence and that varying definitions can limit comparability accross countries.Species assessed as Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN), or Vulnerable (VU) are referred to as \"threatened\" species. Reporting the proportion of threatened species on The IUCN Red List is complicated by the fact that not all species groups have been fully evaluated, and also by the fact that some species have so little information available that they can only be assessed as Data Deficient (DD). For many of the incompletely evaluated groups, assessment efforts have focused on species that are likely to be threatened; therefore any percentage of threatened species reported for these groups would be heavily biased (i.e., the % threatened species would likely be an overestimate)."

For exceptions and for definitions of statistical territories, please refer to country notes.Following the UN recommendations, the international merchandise trade statistics record all goods which add to or subtract from the stock of material resources of a country by entering (imports) or leaving (exports) its economic territory. Goods simply being transported through a country (goods in transit) or temporarily admitted or withdrawn (except for goods for inward or outward processing) do not add to or subtract from the stock of material resources of a country and are not included in the international merchandise trade statistics. Customs records should be the main source of the data; and the additional sources could be used where customs sources are not available. Goods should be included in statistics at the time when they enter or leave the economic territory of a country. In the case of customs-based data collection systems, the time of recording should be the date of lodgement of the customs declaration.Lists of goods to be included, to be recorded separately and to be excluded should be provided. Specific goods are to be excluded from detailed international merchandise trade statistics but recorded separately in order to derive totals of international merchandise trade for national accounts and balance of payments purposes.Trade systemThere are two trade systems in common use by which international merchandise trade statistics are compiled: general trade system and special trade system. The United Nations recommendations advise using the general trade system that provides a more comprehensive recording of external trade flows than does the special system. It also provides a better approximation of the change of ownership criterion used in the 1993 SNA and BPM5. General trade includes all goods that cross the national frontier including goods that are imported into and exported from custom-bonded warehouses and free zones. The general trade system is in use when the statistical territory of a country coincides with its economic territory so that imports include all goods entering the economic territory of a compiling country and exports include all goods leaving the economic territory of a compiling country.Special trade covers goods that cross the customs frontier plus goods that are imported into and exported from custom-bonded areas. The special trade system is in use when the statistical territory comprises only a particular part of the economic territory. Coverage of tradeThe data cover all goods which add to, or subtract from, the resources of a country as a result of their movement into or out of the country. The following types of goods are therefore included or excluded:Goods to be included in the detailed international trade statistics:- Non-monetary gold; goods traded on government account; food and other humanitarian aid; goods for military use; goods on consignment; goods used as carriers of information and software (CD-ROM, diskettes); goods for processing; returned goods; electricity, gas and water; goods under financial lease; ships, aircraft and other mobile equipment; sea products landed direct from the high seas.Goods to be excluded in the detailed international trade statistics:- Monetary gold, direct transit trade, temporary imports and exports, transactions in second-hand ships and aircraft, stores and bunkers for ships and aircraft; goods treated as part of trade in services; goods for repair.MethodologyTrade data collected by OECD mostly follow the UN recommendations. Furthermore, in European countries, two systems of data collection coexist, i.e. Extra-stats and Intrastat. Extra-EU trade statistics record movable property imported and exported by the EU Member country from and to countries outside the European community. Intra-EU trade statistics include the arrival and dispatch of movable property within the European community as recorded by each Member state of the EU.Geographical classificationThe geographical classification refers to areas of origin (or country of consignment) for imports and areas of consumption (last known destination) for exports. The statistical territory of these countries is defined in the OECD Geographical Nomenclature.A lot of methodological information about mirror statistics, measurement of EU trade, adjustements od merchandise trade for Balance of Payments are available in the The Statistics Brief, October 2001."

There can be methodological differences, which make precise comparison of these statistics impossible.The principal differences are as follows:- Breakdown by partner countryFor arrivals of goods from other EU Member States, certain EU Member States record the country of origin as the partner country in their national statistics, whereas it is the EU Member State of consignment that appears in the Community statistics relating to the same goods movement. - Treatment of goods in transitSome EU Member States, particularly Belgium and the Netherlands do not record goods, which they consider to be 'in transit'. This covers, firstly, the import of goods from non-member countries which are customs cleared in these EU Member States before being dispatched on to other EU Member States and, secondly, goods from other EU Member States which are then immediately re-exported to non-member countries.These goods are normally recorded for Community Statistics purposes under intra- or extra-EU trade, as appropriate. This phenomenon is known as the 'Rotterdam effect'.- Other differencesOther methodological differences can cause discrepancies between national and Community statistics (for example: classification at national level as 'general trade' rather than 'special trade', or not recording 'repairs' on the grounds that they are considered as services).Example :Japanese goods are imported into Europe; they are released for free circulation in Germany, then dispatched to France (EU Member State of consumption). For such an operation, the various recordings will be as follows:For European statistics, three operations are recorded:- import of goods originating in Japan (with Germany as the declaring Member State, since the customs declaration is made there);- dispatch (intra) from Germany to France;- arrival (intra) in France from Germany.For German national statistics, no trade is recorded, as the import from Japan and dispatch to France is regarded as transit.For French national statistics, goods originating in Japan are entered as imports. France records Japan as the country of origin, as indicated on the Intrastat declaration. This information is considered statistically more relevant at national level."

          "keyStatisticalConcept": "In general, data comply with the UN recommandations defined in International Merchandise Trade Statistics: Concepts and Definitions, Revision 2 (IMTS, Rev.2). For exceptions and for definitions of statistical territories, please refer to country notes.Following the UN recommendations, the international merchandise trade statistics record all goods which add to or subtract from the stock of material resources of a country by entering (imports) or leaving (exports) its economic territory. Goods simply being transported through a country (goods in transit) or temporarily admitted or withdrawn (except for goods for inward or outward processing) do not add to or subtract from the stock of material resources of a country and are not included in the international merchandise trade statistics. Customs records should be the main source of the data; and the additional sources could be used where customs sources are not available. Goods should be included in statistics at the time when they enter or leave the economic territory of a country. In the case of customs-based data collection systems, the time of recording should be the date of lodgement of the customs declaration.Lists of goods to be included, to be recorded separately and to be excluded should be provided. Specific goods are to be excluded from detailed international merchandise trade statistics but recorded separately in order to derive totals of international merchandise trade for national accounts and balance of payments purposes.Trade systemThere are two trade systems in common use by which international merchandise trade statistics are compiled: general trade system and special trade system. The United Nations recommendations advise using the general trade system that provides a more comprehensive recording of external trade flows than does the special system. It also provides a better approximation of the change of ownership criterion used in the 1993 SNA and BPM5. General trade includes all goods that cross the national frontier including goods that are imported into and exported from custom-bonded warehouses and free zones. The general trade system is in use when the statistical territory of a country coincides with its economic territory so that imports include all goods entering the economic territory of a compiling country and exports include all goods leaving the economic territory of a compiling country.Special trade covers goods that cross the customs frontier plus goods that are imported into and exported from custom-bonded areas. The special trade system is in use when the statistical territory comprises only a particular part of the economic territory. Coverage of tradeThe data cover all goods which add to, or subtract from, the resources of a country as a result of their movement into or out of the country. The following types of goods are therefore included or excluded:Goods to be included in the detailed international trade statistics:- Non-monetary gold; goods traded on government account; food and other humanitarian aid; goods for military use; goods on consignment; goods used as carriers of information and software (CD-ROM, diskettes); goods for processing; returned goods; electricity, gas and water; goods under financial lease; ships, aircraft and other mobile equipment; sea products landed direct from the high seas.Goods to be excluded in the detailed international trade statistics:- Monetary gold, direct transit trade, temporary imports and exports, transactions in second-hand ships and aircraft, stores and bunkers for ships and aircraft; goods treated as part of trade in services; goods for repair.MethodologyTrade data collected by OECD mostly follow the UN recommendations. Furthermore, in European countries, two systems of data collection coexist, i.e. Extra-stats and Intrastat. Extra-EU trade statistics record movable property imported and exported by the EU Member country from and to countries outside the European community. Intra-EU trade statistics include the arrival and dispatch of movable property within the European community as recorded by each Member state of the EU.Geographical classificationThe geographical classification refers to areas of origin (or country of consignment) for imports and areas of consumption (last known destination) for exports. The statistical territory of these countries is defined in the OECD Geographical Nomenclature.A lot of methodological information about mirror statistics, measurement of EU trade, adjustments of merchandise trade for Balance of Payments ... are available in the The Statistics Brief, October 2001."

In particular, the introduction of Intrastat in 1993 involved a methodological break with the past and affected the quality of the statistics.",
          "recommendedUsesAndLimitations": "UK Data Service Guide to OECD Monthly Statistics of International TradeFollowing the UN recommendations, the interna­tional merchandise trade statistics record all goods which add to or subtract from the stock of material re­sources of a country by entering (imports) or leaving (exports) its economic territory.

Extra-EU trade statistics record movable property imported and exported by the EU Member country with countries outside the European community. Intra-EU trade statistics record the arrival and dispatch of movable goods within the European commu­nity recorded by each Member state of the EU.For exceptions and for defi­nitions of statistical territories, please see country notes.Differences between OECD statistics and Community statistics of EurostatThe Monthly Statistics of International Trade now publishes data received directly from the Statistical Office of the European Communities (EUROSTAT) under the name EU15-Extra EU and EU12-Extra EU which excludes intra EU-trade.As the example below shows, European External Trade Statistics, which cover the European Union as a whole, and the statistics compiled by the EU Member States and sent to OECD, which are concerned with the national dimension, are not always directly comparable. There can be methodological differences, which make precise comparison of these statistics impossible.The principal differences are as follows:- Breakdown by partner countryFor arrivals of goods from other EU Member States, certain EU Member States record the country of origin as the partner country in their national statistics, whereas it is the EU Member State of consignment that appears in the Community statistics relating to the same goods movement. - Treatment of goods in transitSome EU Member States, particularly Belgium and the Netherlands do not record goods, which they consider to be 'in transit'. This covers, firstly, the import of goods from non-member countries which are customs cleared in these EU Member States before being dispatched on to other EU Member States and, secondly, goods from other EU Member States which are then immediately re-exported to non-member countries.These goods are normally recorded for Community Statistics purposes under intra- or extra-EU trade, as appropriate. This phenomenon is known as the 'Rotterdam effect'.- Other differencesOther methodological differences can cause discrepancies between national and Community statistics (for example: classification at national level as 'general trade' rather than 'special trade', or not recording 'repairs' on the grounds that they are considered as services).Example :Japanese goods are imported into Europe; they are released for free circulation in Germany, then dispatched to France (EU Member State of consumption). For such an operation, the various recordings will be as follows:For European statistics, three operations are recorded:- import of goods originating in Japan (with Germany as the declaring Member State, since the customs declaration is made there);- dispatch (intra) from Germany to France;- arrival (intra) in France from Germany.For German national statistics, no trade is recorded, as the import from Japan and dispatch to France is regarded as transit.For French national statistics, goods originating in Japan are entered as imports. France records Japan as the country of origin, as indicated on the Intrastat declaration. This information is considered statistically more relevant at national level."
